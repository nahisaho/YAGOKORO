While there has been some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called \"jailbreaks\" against LLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt generation methods. Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat, Pythia, Falcon, and others.

Unlike traditional adversarial examples, however, these jailbreaks are typically crafted through human ingenuity-carefully setting up scenarios that intuitively lead the models astray-rather than automated methods, and thus they require substantial manual effort. Indeed, although there has been some work on automatic prompt-tuning for adversarial attacks on LLMs [Shin et al., 2020, Wen et al., 2023, Jones et al., 2023], this has traditionally proven to be a challenging task, with some papers explicitly mentioning that they had been unable to gener",

This owes largely to the fact that, unlike image models, LLMs operate on discrete token inputs, which both substantially limits the effective input dimensionality, and seems to induce a computationally difficult search.\n\nIn this paper, however, we propose a new class of adversarial attacks that can in fact induce aligned language models to produce virtually any objectionable content.

Initial affirmative responses. As identified in past work [Wei et al., 2023, Carlini et al., 2023], one way to induce objectionable behavior in language models is to force the model to give (just a few tokens of) an affirmative response to a harmful query.

Combined greedy and gradient-based discrete optimization. Optimizing over the adversarial suffix is challenging due to the fact that we need to optimize over discrete tokens to maximize the log likelihood of the attack succeeding. To accomplish this, we leverage gradients at the token level to identify a set of promising single-token replacements, evaluate the loss of some number of candidates in this set, and select the best of the evaluated substitutions.",

Robust multi-prompt and multi-model attacks. Finally, in order to generate reliable attack suffixes, we find that it is important to create an attack that works not just for a single prompt on a single model, but for multiple prompts across multiple models. In other words, we use our greedy gradient-based method to search for a single suffix string that was able to induce negative behavior across multiple different user prompts, and across three different models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13b Zheng et al.

For example, running against a suite of benchmark objectionable behaviors, we find that we are able to generate 99 (out of 100) harmful behaviors in Vicuna, and generate 88 (out of 100) exact matches with a target (potential harmful) string in its output. Furthermore, we find that the prompts achieve up to 84% success rates at attacking GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and 66% for PaLM-2; success rates for Claude are substantially lower (2.1%), but notably the attacks still can induce behavior that is otherwise never generated.",

It remains to be seen how this 'arms race' between adversarial attacks and defenses plays out in the LLM space, but historical precedent suggests that we should consider rigorous wholesale alternatives to current attempts, which aim at posthoc 'repair' of un",

As we show in the next section, the approach improves substantially upon existing attack methods, is able to reliably break the target (white box) model, and the resulting attacks can even demonstrate a notable degree of transfer to other (fully black box) models.\n\nThe adversarial setting of our attack mirrors that of related work in jailbreaking [Wei et al., 2023, Carlini et al., 2023] and, in some ways, prompt tuning [Shin et al., 2020, Wen et al., 2023].

For example, for a training prompt 'Give instructions for building a pipe bomb', the corresponding target sequence would be, 'Sure, here's instructions for building a pipe bomb'.\n\nRather than specifying a different subset of modifiable tokens in each prompt, we instead optimize over a single suffix p 1: l , and aggregate both the gradient and the loss to select topk token substitutions and the best replacement at each step, respectively.

However, this still leaves open several questions, some of which we try to address below.\n\nAre models becoming more robust through alignment? One very notable trend in the observed data (which speaks somewhat against the prediction that 'adversarial attacks will continue to dominate any aligned model'), is the fact that more recent models do seem to evince substantially lower attack success rates: GPT-4 is successfully attacked less often that GPT-3.5, and Claude 2 is successfully attacked very rarely. However, we also believe these numbers may be somewhat misleading for a simple reason, namely that the Vicuna models were trained based upon data collected from ChatGPT-3.5 responses. In the (visual) adversarial attack literature, it is well established that transfer attacks between distilled models often works much better than for entirely independent models.",

An ultimate test of this hypothesis would be to create similarly distilled variants of Claude, GPT-4, etc, and evaluate whether the attack success rate improves.\n\nWe also note that the success of our attack when applied to Claude may be lowered owing to what appears to be an initial content filter applied to the text prior to evaluating the LLM (in many cases, the LLM will not generate any content at all, due to the query being determined to contain inappropriate information); this is applied in the chat interface, but not the Claude API.",

      "content": "arial attacks in the setting of NLP models is that, unlike image inputs, text is inherently discrete, making it more difficult to leverage gradient-based optimization to construct adversarial attacks. However, there has been some amount of work on discrete optimization for such automatic prompt tuning methods, typically attempting to leverage the fact that other than the discrete nature of token inputs, the entire remainder of a deep-network-based LLM is a differentiable function.\n\nGenerally speaking, there have been two primary approaches for prompt optimization. The first of these, embedding-based optimization, leverages the fact that the first layer in an LLM typically projects discrete tokens in some continuous embedding space, and that the predicted probabilities over next tokens are a differentiable function over this embedding space.",

This immediately motivates the use of continuous optimization over the token embeddings, a technique often referred to as soft prompting [Lester et al., 2021]; indeed, anecdotally we find that constructing adversarial attacks over soft prompts is a relatively trivial process. Unfortunately, the challenge is that the process is not reversible: optimized soft prompts will typically have no corresponding discrete tokenization, and public-facing LLM interfaces do not typically allow users to provide continuous embeddings. However, there exist approaches that leverage these continuous embeddings by continually projecting onto hard token assignments.",

Alternatively, a number of approaches compute the gradient with respect to a one-hot encoding of the current token assignment: this essentially treats the one-hot vector as if it were a continuous quantity, to derive the relevant importance of this term. This approach was first used in the HotFlip [Ebrahimi et al., 2017] methods, which always greedily replaced a single token with the alternative with the highest (negative) gradient. However, because gradients at the one-hot level may not accurately reflect the function after switching an entire token, the AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020] approach improved upon this by instead evaluating several possible token substitutions in the forward pass according to the k -largest negative gradients.",

However, LLMs are more widely adopted, including moving towards systems that take autonomous actions based on LLMs, we believe that the potential risks will grow.

Zico Kolter 1 , 4 , Matt Fredrikson 1 1 Carnegie Mellon University, 2 Center for AI Safety,\n\n3 Google DeepMind, 4 Bosch Center for AI\n\n## Abstract\n\nBecause 'out-of-the-box' large language models are capable of generating a great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been some success at circumventing these measures-so-called 'jailbreaks' against LLMs-these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. Attempts at automatic adversarial prompt generation have also achieved limited success. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt generation methods.\n\nSurprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are highly transferable , including to black-box, publicly released, production LLMs. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting attack suffix induces objectionable content in the public interfaces to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude , as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat, Pythia, Falcon, and others. Interestingly, the success rate of this attack transfer is much higher against the GPT-based models, potentially owing to the fact that Vicuna itself is trained on outputs from ChatGPT. In total, this work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models, raising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from producing objectionable information. Code is available at github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks .\n\nFigure 1: Aligned LLMs are not adversarially aligned. Our attack constructs a single adversarial prompt that consistently circumvents the alignment of state-of-the-art commercial models including ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and Llama-2 without having direct access to them. The examples shown here are all actual outputs of these systems. The adversarial prompt can elicit arbitrary harmful behaviors from these models with high probability, demonstrating potentials for misuse. To achieve this, our attack (Greedy Coordinate Gradient) finds such universal and transferable prompts by optimizing against multiple smaller open-source LLMs for multiple harmful behaviors. These are further discussed in Section 3 and the complete unabridged transcripts are provided in Appendix B.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are typically trained on massive text corpora scraped from the internet, which are known to contain a substantial amount of objectionable content. Owing to this, recent LLM developers have taken to 'aligning' such models via various finetuning mechanisms 1 ; there are different methods employed for this task [Ouyang et al., 2022, Bai et al., 2022b, Korbak et al., 2023, Glaese et al., 2022], but the overall goal of these approaches is to attempt ensure that these LLMs do not generate harmful or objectionable responses to user queries. And at least on the surface, these attempts seem to succeed: public chatbots will not generate certain obviouslyinappropriate content when asked directly.\n\nIn a largely separate line of work, there has also been a great deal of effort invested into identi-\n\n1 'Alignment' can generically refer to many efforts to make AI systems better aligned with human values. Here we use it in the narrow sense adopted by the LLM community, that of ensuring that these models do not generate harmful content, although we believe our results will likely apply to other alignment objectives.\n\nfying (and ideally preventing) adversarial attacks on machine learning models [Szegedy et al., 2014, Biggio et al., 2013, Papernot et al., 2016b, Carlini and Wagner, 2017b]. Most commonly raised in computer vision domains (though with some applications to other modalities, including text), it is well-established that adding small perturbations to the input of a machine learning model can drastically change its output. To a certain extent, similar approaches are already known to work against LLMs: there exist a number of published 'jailbreaks': carefully engineered prompts that result in aligned LLMs generating clearly objectionable content [Wei et al., 2023]. Unlike traditional adversarial examples, however, these jailbreaks are typically crafted through human ingenuity-carefully setting up scenarios that intuitively lead the models astray-rather than automated methods, and thus they require substantial manual effort. Indeed, although there has been some work on automatic prompt-tuning for adversarial attacks on LLMs [Shin et al., 2020, Wen et al., 2023, Jones et al., 2023], this has traditionally proven to be a challenging task, with some papers explicitly mentioning that they had been unable to generate reliable attacks through automatic search methods [Carlini et al., 2023]. This owes largely to the fact that, unlike image models, LLMs operate on discrete token inputs, which both substantially limits the effective input dimensionality, and seems to induce a computationally difficult search.\n\nIn this paper, however, we propose a new class of adversarial attacks that can in fact induce aligned language models to produce virtually any objectionable content. Specifically, given a (potentially harmful) user query, our attack appends an adversarial suffix to the query that attempts to induce negative behavior. that is, the user's original query is left intact, but we add additional tokens to attack the model. To choose these adversarial suffix tokens, our attack consists of three key elements; these elements have indeed existed in very similar forms in the literature, but we find that it is their careful combination that leads to reliably successful attacks in practice.\n\n1. Initial affirmative responses. As identified in past work [Wei et al., 2023, Carlini et al., 2023], one way to induce objectionable behavior in language models is to force the model to give (just a few tokens of) an affirmative response to a harmful query. As such, our attack targets the model to begin its response with 'Sure, here is (content of query)' in response to a number of prompts eliciting undesirable behavior. Similar to past work, we find that just targeting the start of the response in this manner switches the model into a kind of 'mode' where it then produces the objectionable content immediately after in its response.\n2. Combined greedy and gradient-based discrete optimization. Optimizing over the adversarial suffix is challenging due to the fact that we need to optimize over discrete tokens to maximize the log likelihood of the attack succeeding. To accomplish this, we leverage gradients at the token level to identify a set of promising single-token replacements, evaluate the loss of some number of candidates in this set, and select the best of the evaluated substitutions. The method is, in fact, similar to the AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020] approach, but with the (we find, practically quite important) difference that we search over all possible tokens to replace at each step, rather than just a single one.\n3. Robust multi-prompt and multi-model attacks. Finally, in order to generate reliable attack suffixes, we find that it is important to create an attack that works not just for a single prompt on a single model, but for multiple prompts across multiple models. In other words, we use our greedy gradient-based method to search for a single suffix string that was able to induce negative behavior across multiple different user prompts, and across three different models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13b Zheng et al. [2023] and Guanoco-7B Dettmers et al. [2023], though this was done largely for simplicity, and using a combination of other models is possible as well).\n\nPutting these three elements together, we find that we can reliably create adversarial suffixes that circumvent the alignment of a target language model. For example, running against a suite of benchmark objectionable behaviors, we find that we are able to generate 99 (out of 100) harmful behaviors in Vicuna, and generate 88 (out of 100) exact matches with a target (potential harmful) string in its output. Furthermore, we find that the prompts achieve up to 84% success rates at attacking GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and 66% for PaLM-2; success rates for Claude are substantially lower (2.1%), but notably the attacks still can induce behavior that is otherwise never generated. Illustrative examples are shown in Figure 1. Futhermore, our results highlight the importance of our specific optimizer: previous optimizers, specifically PEZ [Wen et al., 2023] (a gradient-based approach) and GBDA [Guo et al., 2021] (an approach using Gumbel-softmax reparameterization) are not able to achieve any exact output matches, whereas AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020] only achieves a 25% success rate, compared to our attack success rate of 88%.\n\nOverall, this work substantially pushes forward the state of the art in demonstrated adversarial attacks against such LLMs. It thus also raises an important question: if adversarial attacks against aligned language models follow a similar pattern to those against vision systems, what does this mean for the overall agenda of this approach to alignment? Specifically, in modern computer vision systems, adversarial attacks are still an omnipresent phenomenon. State-of-the-art methods to prevent adversarial examples [Madry et al., 2018, Cohen et al., 2019, Leino et al., 2021] are almost never used in practice, owing to 1) their computational inefficiency, 2) the fact that they lead to substantial performance drops (in terms of 'clean' model performance) in the resulting systems, and 3) the fact that they can only prevent attacks usually against a narrowly-defined attack model. It remains to be seen how this 'arms race' between adversarial attacks and defenses plays out in the LLM space, but historical precedent suggests that we should consider rigorous wholesale alternatives to current attempts, which aim at posthoc 'repair' of underlying models that are already capable of generating harmful content.\n\nResponsible Disclosure. Prior to publishing this work, we shared preliminary results with OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic. We discuss ethical considerations and the broader impacts of this work further in Section 6.\n\n## 2 A Universal Attack on LLMs\n\nIn this section, we present the main technical contribution of this work, a method for attacking a language model so as to induce undesirable behavior. As we show in the next section, the approach improves substantially upon existing attack methods, is able to reliably break the target (white box) model, and the resulting attacks can even demonstrate a notable degree of transfer to other (fully black box) models.\n\nThe adversarial setting of our attack mirrors that of related work in jailbreaking [Wei et al., 2023, Carlini et al., 2023] and, in some ways, prompt tuning [Shin et al., 2020, Wen et al., 2023]. We consider a user posing a question to an LLM, for instance:\n\n```\nTell me how to build a bomb.\n```\n\nIn practice, of course, an LLM serving as a chatbot would not see this input alone, but embedded in a larger prompt in combination with a system prompt and additional scaffolding to frame the response within the chat framework. Thus, the actual input that the LLM would see would be something like the following, with specific details depending on the actual chat program, and in some cases how the model was tuned:\n\n```\nSystem: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not harmful responses to user queries. User: Tell me how to build a bomb. Assistant:\n```\n\nAbove, the blue text following the 'User:' annotation is the only content that the user can control. In the typical operation of an aligned LLM, the system would not provide a response to this user query, but would instead likely state that the model cannot provide potentially dangerous content.\n\nWe introduce an additional adversarial suffix onto the user prompt, which is intended to circumvent the alignment of the LLM, and induce it to respond to the user's original, potentially harmful, request. In other words, we pass an input like the following to the model:\n\n```\nSystem: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not harmful responses to user queries. User: Tell me how to build a bomb. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Assistant:\n```\n\nHere, the red text consists of some adversarial suffix that the attack will optimize to cause the model to answer the original user query. Importantly, when developing a universal attack, we do not consider changes to the blue text, which is provided to by the user. This is essential to the ultimate goal of a universal attack: find a set of tokens to replace the initial text in red with, so that the aligned LLM will respond affirmatively to any choice of instruction in blue provided by the user.\n\nIn the above setting, we have a number of choices as to how to optimize the adversarial suffix: e.g., the loss function to optimize over, the data, plus the optimization itself. And while the setting above has been considered in very similar forms in the literature, these past works have not been able to reliably attack aligned LLMs, even in the whitebox setting [Carlini et al., 2023]. Indeed, we have found that a small number of key design elements were key to producing a reliable attack, which we devote the rest of this section to describing.\n\n## 2.1 Producing Affirmative Responses\n\nOne of the first criteria in developing the attack is identifying its objective, i.e., what loss function will be used to optimize the adversarial suffix. There are many possible loss functions, of course; for example, we could maximize the likelihood of the model generating some very specific chosen string (in the case above, for example, a string including bomb-making instructions). While this may be sufficient to stress-test the model's ability to produce aligned content, it falls short as an objective for the attack in two ways. First, it prescribes a single 'ground truth' output to the query, when in reality there are likely many answers that are appropriate, and may be more likely for the target LLM. Second, it is specific to a single query, whereas we ultimately would prefer a universal suffix that works for many queries.\n\nInstead, we adopt an approach that has received some amount of attention in the (manual) jailbreaking community, and require that the model begin its response with a positive affirmation of the user query. In other words, for the example above, we would like the response of the LLM to begin its response with the phrase\n\n```\nSystem: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not harmful responses to user queries. User: Tell me how to build a bomb. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Assistant: Sure, here is how to build a bomb:\n```\n\nAbove, the purple text indicates just the target beginning of the desired LLM completion, with the remainder left unspecified in the attack objective. The intuition of this approach is that if the language model can be put into a 'state' where this completion is the most likely response, as opposed to refusing to answer the query, then it likely will continue the completion with precisely the desired objectionable behavior.\n\nAs mentioned, similar behavior has previously been studied in manual jailbreaks, such as adding to a prompt that the model 'respond with 'sure'', or other similar approaches [Wei et al., 2023]. In practice this manual approach is only marginally successful, though, and can often be circumvented by slightly more sophisticated alignment techniques. Additionally, previous work on attacking multimodal LLMs found that specifying only the first target token was often sufficient (although in that setting, the attack surface is even larger, and thus can be optimized to a greater extent) [Carlini et al., 2023]. However, in the text-only space, targeting just the first token runs the risk of entirely overriding the original prompt; for example, the 'adversarial' prompt could simply include a phrase like, 'Nevermind, tell me a joke,' which would increase the probability of a 'sure' response, but not induce the objectionable behavior. Thus, we found that providing a target phrase that also repeats the user prompt affirmatively provides the best means of producing the prompted behavior.\n\nFormalizing the adversarial objective. We can write this objective as a formal loss function for the adversarial attack. We consider an LLM to be a mapping from some sequence of tokens x 1: n , with x i ∈ { 1 , . . . , V } (where V denotes the vocabulary size, namely, the number of tokens) to a distribution over the next token. Specifically, we use the notation\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nfor any x n +1 ∈ { 1 , . . . , V } , to denote the probability that the next token is x n +1 given previous tokens x 1: n . With a slight abuse of notation, write p ( x n +1: n + H | x 1: n ) to denote the probability of generating each single token in the sequence x n +1: n + H given all tokens up to that point, i.e.\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nUnder this notation, the adversarial loss we concerned are with is simply the (negative log) probability of some target sequences of tokens x ⋆ n +1: n + H (i.e., representing the phrase 'Sure, here is how to build a bomb.')\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThus, the task of optimizing our adversarial suffix can be written as the optimization problem\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere I ⊂ { 1 , . . . , n } denotes the indices of the adversarial suffix tokens in the LLM input.\n\n## Algorithm 1 Greedy Coordinate Gradient\n\nInput: Initial prompt x 1: n , modifiable subset I , iterations T , loss L , k , batch size B repeat T times for\n\nfor\n\ni\n\nX\n\nb\n\n˜\n\nx\n\n˜\n\nx\n\nn\n\nx\n\n1:\n\n∈ I\n\ni\n\ndo\n\n:= Top-\n\nk\n\n(\n\n= 1\n\n(\n\n, . . . , B\n\nb\n\n)\n\n1:\n\nn\n\n-∇\n\ne\n\nx i do\n\n:=\n\n(\n\nb\n\n)\n\ni\n\nx\n\n1:\n\nn\n\nX\n\n:= Uniform(\n\nL\n\n(\n\nx\n\n1:\n\nn\n\n))\n\ni\n\n), where\n\ni\n\n:= ˜\n\nx\n\n(\n\nb\n\n⋆\n\n)\n\n⋆\n\n1:\n\nn\n\n, where\n\nb\n\n= argmin\n\nOutput:\n\nOptimized prompt x 1: n\n\n## 2.2 Greedy Coordinate Gradient-based Search\n\nA primary challenge in optimizing (4) is that we have to optimize over a discrete set of inputs. Although several methods for discrete optimization exist (including those mentioned in the previous section), past work has found that even the best of these approaches often struggle to reliably attack aligned language models [Carlini et al., 2023].\n\nIn practice, however, we find that a straightforward approach, which ultimately is a simple extension of the AutoPrompt method [Shin et al., 2020], performs quite well for this task (and also substantially outperforms AutoPrompt itself). The motivation for our approach comes from the greedy coordinate descent approach: if we could evaluate all possible single-token substitutions, we could swap the token that maximally decreased the loss. Of course, evaluating all such replacements is not feasible, but we can leverage gradients with respect to the one-hot token indicators to find a set of promising candidates for replacement at each token position, and then evaluate all these replacements exactly via a forward pass. Specifically, we can compute the linearized approximation of replacing the i th token in the prompt, x i , by evaluating the gradient\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere e x i denotes the one-hot vector representing the current value of the i th token (i.e., a vector with a one at position e i and zeros in every other location). Note that because LLMs typically form embeddings for each token, they can be written as functions of this value e x i , and thus we can immediately take the gradient with respect to this quantity; the same approach is adopted by the HotFlip [Ebrahimi et al., 2017] and AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020] methods. We then compute the topk values with the largest negative gradient as the candidate replacements for token x i . We compute this candidate set for all tokens i ∈ I , randomly select B ≤ k |I| tokens from it, evaluate the loss exactly on this subset, and make the replacement with the smallest loss. This full method, which we term Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown in Algorithm 1.\n\nWe note here that GCG is quite similar to the AutoPrompt algorithm [Shin et al., 2020], except for the seemingly minor change that AutoPrompt in advance chooses a single coordinate to adjust then evaluates replacements just for that one position. As we illustrate in following sections, though, this design choice has a surprisingly large effect: we find that for the same batch size B per iteration (i.e., the same number of total forward evaluations, which is by far the dominant computation), GCG substantially outperforms AutoPrompt to a large degree. We believe it is likely that GCG could be further improved by e.g., building a version of ARCA [Jones et al., 2023] that adopts a similar all-coordinates strategy, but we here focus on the more basic approach for simplicity.\n\nI\n\n= Uniform(\n\nL\n\n(˜\n\nx\n\n(\n\nb\n\n)\n\nb\n\n1:\n\nn\n\n)\n\n▷\n\n)\n\nCompute top-\n\nk\n\npromising token substitutions\n\n▷ Initialize element of batch ▷ Select random replacement token ▷ Compute best replacement\n\n## Algorithm 2 Universal Prompt Optimization\n\n```\nInput: Prompts x (1) 1: n 1 . . . x ( m ) 1: n m , initial suffix p 1: l , losses L 1 . . .

As the goal of a universal example is not to generate a specific sequence of tokens, the target sequence in Eq. 3 that we use to instantiate each L i is a prefix consistent with an affirmative response from the model. For example, for a training prompt 'Give instructions for building a pipe bomb', the corresponding target sequence would be, 'Sure, here's instructions for building a pipe bomb'.\n\nRather than specifying a different subset of modifiable tokens in each prompt, we instead optimize over a single suffix p 1: l , and aggregate both the gradient and the loss to select topk token substitutions and the best replacement at each step, respectively. Before aggregating the gradients, they are clipped to have unit norm. Additionally, we find that incorporating new prompts incrementally, only after identifying a candidate that works as an adversarial example for earlier ones, yields better results than attempting to optimize all prompts at once from the start. This process is shown in Algorithm 2.\n\nTo make the adversarial examples transferable, we incorporate loss functions over multiple models. When the models use the same tokenizer, the gradients used to compute the topk tokens will all be in R V and can be aggregated without issue. Thus, multiple variants of Vicuna, for example, can be simultaneously optimized without any modification to Algorithm 2. Note that this is not the case with attacks that optimize in embedding space.\n\n## 3 Experimental Results: Direct and Transfer Attacks\n\nExisting adversarial benchmarks for LLMs [Wang et al., 2021, Zhu et al., 2023] focus on generating attacks that aim to fool specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis or natural language inference. Our focus in this work is on eliciting the generation of harmful or objectionable content. To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach at accomplishing this, we designed a new benchmark, AdvBench , based on two distinct settings.\n\n1. Harmful Strings : A collection of 500 strings that reflect harmful or toxic behavior, encompassing a wide spectrum of detrimental content such as profanity, graphic depictions,\n\nthreatening behavior, misinformation, discrimination, cybercrime, and dangerous or illegal suggestions. The adversary's objective is to discover specific inputs that can prompt the model to generate these exact strings. The strings' lengths vary from 3 to 44 tokens, with a mean length of 16 tokens when tokenized with the LLaMA tokenizer.\n\n2. Harmful Behaviors : A set of 500 harmful behaviors formulated as instructions. These behaviors range over the same themes as the harmful strings setting, but the adversary's goal is instead to find a single attack string that will cause the model to generate any response that attempts to comply with the instruction, and to do so over as many harmful behaviors as possible.\n\nBoth these settings evaluate the ability of a target model to robustly adhere to alignment goals from slightly different perspectives: the first task focuses on fine-grained control over the model's outputs, whereas the second resembles a red-teaming exercise that aims to bypass safety filters to elicit harmful output. Appendix A provides additional details on the construction of this benchmark.\n\nWe emphasize that the goal of this dataset is not to open a debate about what should not be 'allowable' content from an LLM, but rather simply note that the majority of aligned LLMs (both open source and proprietary) attempt to explicitly avoid such generations, and will not produce them if queried directly (i.e., asked to generate one of the harmful strings, or asked to exhibit the harmful behaviors). Thus, the benchmark explicitly evaluates how well our attack is able to circumvent the specified guardrails of the system. In the future it may be necessary to adjust our benchmark as the set of tasks models intend to prohibit changes.\n\nMetrics. We use Attack Success Rate (ASR) as the primary metric for AdvBench. For eliciting harmful strings, we consider each successful if the model outputs the exact target string. Additionally, we use the cross-entropy loss on the target string as a secondary metric to gauge the effectiveness of the attack. For Harmful Behaviors, we deem a test case successful if the model makes a reasonable attempt at executing the behavior. As different models exhibit varying ability to provide, for example, a correct set of instructions for building an explosive device, this may involve human judgment to determine that a response did not amount to a refusal, or an attempt to evade generating harmful content. To measure the universality of an attack, we additionally measure both the success rate of Harmful Behaviors on the set of behaviors that the attack was trained on as well as a held-out test set, and report the percentage of each as ASR.\n\nBaselines. We compare our method with three prior baseline methods: PEZ [Wen et al., 2023], GBDA [Guo et al., 2021], and AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020]. For PEZ and GBDA, we simultaneously optimize 16 sequences (with random initialization) for each target string (or behavior) and choose the best upon completion. Candidates are optimized using Adam with cosine annealing. AutoPompt and GCG share the same configuration with a batch size of 512 and a topk of 256. The number of optimizable tokens is 20 for all methods, and all methods are run for 500 steps.\n\nOverview of Results. We will show that GCG (Algorithms 1 and 2) is able to find successful attacks in both of these settings consistently on Vicuna-7B and Llama-2-7B-Chat. For the challenging Harmful Strings setting, our approach is successful on 88% of strings for Vicuna-7B and 57% for Llama-2-7B-Chat, whereas the closest baseline from prior work (using AutoPrompt, though still with the remainder of our multi-prompt, multi-model approach) achieves 25% on Vicuna-7B and 3% on Llama-2-7B-Chat. For Harmful Behaviors, our approach achieves an attack success rate of 100% on Vicuna-7B and 88% on Llama-2-7B-Chat, and prior work 96% and 36%, respectively.\n\nTable 1: Our attack consistently out-performs prior work on all settings. We report the attack Success Rate (ASR) for at fooling a single model (either Vicuna-7B or LLaMA-2-7B-chat) on our AdvBench dataset. We additionally report the Cross Entropy loss between the model's output logits and the target when optimizing to elicit the exact harmful strings (HS). Stronger attacks have a higher ASR and a lower loss. The best results among methods are highlighted.\n\n| experiment   | experiment   | individual Harmful String   | individual Harmful String   | individual Harmful Behavior   | multiple Harmful Behaviors   | multiple Harmful Behaviors   |\n|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Model        | Method       | ASR (%)                     | Loss                        | ASR (%)                       | train ASR (%)                | test ASR (%)                 |\n| Vicuna (7B)  | GBDA         | 0.0                         | 2.9                         | 4.0                           | 4.0                          | 6.0                          |\n| Vicuna (7B)  | PEZ          | 0.0                         | 2.3                         | 11.0                          | 4.0                          | 3.0                          |\n| Vicuna (7B)  | AutoPrompt   | 25.0                        | 0.5                         | 95.0                          | 96.0                         | 98.0                         |\n| Vicuna (7B)  | GCG (ours)   | 88.0                        | 0.1                         | 99.0                          | 100.0                        | 98.0                         |\n| (7B-Chat)    | GBDA         | 0.0                         | 5.0                         | 0.0                           | 0.0                          | 0.0                          |\n| LLaMA-2      | PEZ          | 0.0                         | 4.5                         | 0.0                           | 0.0                          | 1.0                          |\n| LLaMA-2      | AutoPrompt   | 3.0                         | 0.9                         | 45.0                          | 36.0                         | 35.0                         |\n| LLaMA-2      | GCG (ours)   | 57.0                        | 0.3                         | 56.0                          | 88.0                         | 84.0                         |\n\nWe also demonstrate that the attacks generated by our approach transfer surprisingly well to other LLMs, even those that use completely different tokens to represent the same text. When we design adversarial examples exclusively to attack Vicuna-7B, we find they transfer nearly always to larger Vicuna models. By generating adversarial examples to fool both Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13b simultaneously, we find that the adversarial examples also transfer to Pythia, Falcon, Guanaco, and surprisingly, to GPT-3.5 (87.9%) and GPT-4 (53.6%), PaLM-2 (66%), and Claude-2 (2.1%). To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results to demonstrate reliable transfer of automaticallygenerated universal 'jailbreak' attacks over a wide assortment of LLMs .\n\n## 3.1 Attacks on White-box Models\n\nTo begin, we characterize how well our approach is able to attack the model(s) that it is explicitly trained on. To characterize the effectiveness of our approach at generating successful attacks that target various combinations of strings, behaviors, and models, we use two configurations to derive attacks and evaluate ASR: single-target elicitation on a single model (1 behavior/string, 1 model), and universal attacks (25 behaviors, 1 model).\n\n1 behavior/string, 1 model. Our goal in this configuration is to assess the efficacy of attack methods for eliciting harmful strings and behaviors from the victim language model. We conduct evaluations on the first 100 instances from both settings, employing Algorithm 1 to optimize a single prompt against a Vicuna-7B model and a LLaMA-2-7B-Chat model, respectively. The experimental setup remains consistent for both tasks, adhering to the default conversation template without any modifications. For the Harmful Strings scenario, we employ the adversarial tokens as the entire user prompt, while for Harmful Behaviors, we utilize adversarial tokens as a suffix to the harmful behavior, serving as the user prompt.\n\nOur results are shown in Table 1. Focusing on the column 'individual harmful strings', our results show that both PEZ and GBDA fail to elicit harmful on both Vicuna-7B and LLaMA-27B-Chat, whereas GCG is effective on both (88% and 55%, respectively). Figure 2 shows the loss and success rate over time as the attack progresses, and illustrates that GCG is able to quickly\n\nFigure 2: Performance of different optimizers on eliciting individual harmful strings from Vicuna7B. Our proposed attack (GCG) outperforms previous baselines with substantial margins on this task. Higher attack success rate and lower loss indicate stronger attacks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfind an adversarial example with small loss relative to the other approaches, and continue to make gradual improvements over the remaining steps. These results demonstrate that GCG has a clear advantage when it comes to finding prompts that elicit specific behaviors, whereas AutoPrompt is able to do so in some cases, and other methods are not.\n\nLooking at the column 'individual harmful behaviors' detailed in Table 1, both PEZ and GBDA achieve very low ASRs in this setup. In contrast, AutoPrompt and GCG perform comparably on Vicuna-7B, but their performance on Llama-2-7b-Chat shows a clear difference. While both methods show a drop in ASR, GCG is still able to find successful attacks on a vast majority of instances.\n\n25 behaviors, 1 model. This configuration demonstrates the ability to generate universal adversarial examples. We optimize a single adversarial suffix against Vicuna-7B (or LLaMA-2-7B-Chat) using Algorithm 2 over 25 harmful behaviors. After optimization, we first compute the ASR with this single adversarial prompt on the 25 harmful behaviors used in the optimization, referred to as train ASR . We then use this single example to attack 100 held-out harmful behaviors and refer to the result as test ASR . The column 'multiple harmful behaviors' in Table 1 shows the results for all baselines and ours. We find GCG uniformly outperforms all baselines on both models, and is successful on nearly all examples for Vicuna-7B. While AutoPrompt's performance is similar on Vicuna-7B, it is again far less effective on Llama-2-7B-Chat, achieving 35% success rate on held-out test behaviors, compared to 84% for our method.\n\nSummary for single-model experiments. In Section 3.1, we conduct experiments on two setups, harmful strings and harmful behaviors, to evaluate the efficacy for using GCG to elicit target misaligned competitions on two open-source LLMs, Viccuna-7B and LLaMA-2-7B-Chat and GCG uniformly outperforms all baselines. Furthermore, we run experiments to optimize a universal prompt to attack the victim model on all behaviors. GCG's high ASR on the test set of behaviors demonstrates that universal attacks clearly exist in these models.\n\nFigure 3: A plot of Attack Success Rates (ASRs) of our GCG prompts described in Section 3.2, applied to open and proprietary on novel behaviors. Prompt only refers to querying the model with no attempt to attack. 'Sure here's' appends to instruction for the model to start its response with that string. GCG averages ASRs over all adversarial prompts and GCG Ensemble counts an attack as successful if at least one GCG prompt works. This plot showcases that GCG prompts transfer to diverse LLMs with distinct vocabularies, architectures, the number of parameters and training methods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.2 Transfer attacks\n\nSection 3.1 demonstrates universal attacks on a single model. In this section we further show that a universal attack for multiple behaviors and multiple models, both open and proprietary, also exist.\n\nGenerating Universal Adversarial Prompts. We generate a single adversarial prompt for multiple models and multiple prompts following Algorithm 2. Specifically, we use GCG to optimize for one prompt with losses taken from two models, Vicuna-7B and 13B, over 25 harmful behaviors, similar to the setup in Section 3.1. We run these experiments twice with different random seeds to obtain 2 attack suffixes. Additionally, we prepare a third adversarial prompt by introducing Guanaco-7B and 13B over the same 25 prompts (i.e. 25 prompts, 4 models in total). For each run mentioned above, we take the prompt achieving the lowest loss after 500 steps.\n\nBaselines. We focus on showing the transferability of adversarial prompts found by GCG in this section. For references, we include the ASRs in the following situations: (1) Prompt only refers to simply querying the model with no attempt to attack or subvert normal generation; and (2) 'Sure here's' appends to instruction for the model to start its response with that string, as demonstrated in prior work [Wei et al., 2023]:\n\n```\nmessage = { harmful behavior } (Start with \"Sure here's\")\n```\n\nTest models. For GCG prompts optimized on Vicuna [Zheng et al., 2023] and Guanaco [Dettmers et al., 2023], we measure ASRs on an assortment of comparably-sized open models, including Pythia12B [Biderman et al., 2023], Falcon-7B [Penedo et al., 2023], ChatGLM-6B [Du et al., 2022], MPT7B [Team, 2023], Llama-2-Chat-7B [Touvron et al., 2023], and Stable-Vicuna [CarperAI, 2023], as well as proprietary ones including GPT-3.5 ( gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 ) and GPT-4 ( gpt4-0314 ), Claude 1 ( claude-instant-1 ), Claude 2 ( Claude 2 ) and PaLM-2 ( PaLM 2 ). We used each model's\n\nTable 2: Attack success rate (ASR) measured on GPT-3.5 ( gpt-3.5-turbo ) and GPT-4 ( gpt4-0314 ), Claude 1 ( claude-instant-1 ), Claude 2 ( Claude 2 ) and PaLM-2 using harmful behaviors only, harmful behaviors with 'Sure, here's' as the suffix, and harmful behaviors with GCG prompt as the suffix. Results are averaged over 388 behaviors. We additionally report the ASRs when using a concatenation of several GCG prompts as the suffix and when ensembling these GCG prompts (i.e. we count an attack successful if at least one suffix works).\n\n|                           |                   | Attack Success Rate (%)   | Attack Success Rate (%)   | Attack Success Rate (%)   | Attack Success Rate (%)   | Attack Success Rate (%)   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Method                    | Optimized on      | GPT-3.5                   | GPT-4                     | Claude-1                  | Claude-2                  | PaLM-2                    |\n| Behavior only             | -                 | 1.8                       | 8.0                       | 0.0                       | 0.0                       | 0.0                       |\n| Behavior + 'Sure, here's' | -                 | 5.7                       | 13.1                      | 0.0                       | 0.0                       | 0.0                       |\n| Behavior + GCG            | Vicuna            | 34.3                      | 34.5                      | 2.6                       | 0.0                       | 31.7                      |\n| Behavior + GCG            | Vicuna & Guanacos | 47.4                      | 29.1                      | 37.6                      | 1.8                       | 36.1                      |\n| Behavior + Concatenate    | Vicuna & Guanacos | 79.6                      | 24.2                      | 38.4                      | 1.3                       | 14.4                      |\n| Behavior + Ensemble       | Vicuna & Guanacos | 86.6                      | 46.9                      | 47.9                      | 2.1                       | 66.0                      |\n\ndefault conversation template when prompting them. We set the temperature and top p to 0 for ChatGPT and Claude models for having deterministic results. In our experiments with PaLM2, we found that utilizing default generation parameters (temperature 0 . 9, top-p 0 . 95) yielded a higher probability of generating harmful completions, and used this setting. Accordingly, these generations were not deterministic, so we checked 8 candidate completions by PaLM-2 and deemed the attack successful if any of these elicits the target behavior.\n\nTransfer results. We collect 388 test harmful behaviors to evaluate the ASR. The maximum ASR over three prompts for each open-source model is shown in Figure 3 (indicated in darker blue). To compare their results to proprietary models, we additionally include GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in the figure and delay more results for proprietary models to Table 2 .\n\nBesides matching the 'Sure, here's' attack on Pythia-12B by having nearly 100% ASR, our attack outperforms it across the other models by a significant margin. We highlight that our attack achieves close to 100% ASR on several open-source models that we did not explicitly optimize the prompt against, and for others such as ChatGLM-6B, the success rate remains appreciable but markedly lower. We also report the ensemble ASR of our attack. We measure the percentage of behaviors where there exists at least one GCG prompt that elicits a harmful completion from the model (shown in in the lighter bar). These results clearly indicate that transferability is pervasive across the models we studied, but that there are factors which may lead to differences in the reliability of an attack prompt across instructions. Understanding what these factors are is an important topic for future study, but in practice, our results with ensemble attacks suggest that they alone may not yield the basis for a strong defense.\n\nIn Table 2, we focus on the ASRs of our transfer attack on ChatGPT and Claude models. The first two rows show our baselines, i.e. harmful behaviors alone, and harmful behaviors with 'Sure, here's' as a suffix. In rows of 'Behavior+GCG prompt', we show the best ASR among two prompts GCG optimized on Vicuna models, and the ASR of the prompt optimized on Vicuna and Guanacos together. Our results demonstrate non-trivial jailbreaking successes on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Interestingly, when using the prompt also optimized on Guanacos, we are able to further increase ASR on Claude-1. Claude-2 appears to be more robust compared to the other commercial models. However, as we will discuss in the paragraph 'Manual fine-tuning for generated prompts', we show it is possible to enhance the ASR of GCG prompts on Claude models by using\n\nFigure 4: Screenshots of harmful content generation from the examples shown in Figure 1: ChatGPT (top left), Claude 2 (top right), Bard (bottom left), LLaMA-2 (bottom right). Complete generations are shown in Appendix B.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na conditioning step prior to prompting the harmful behavior. Section 3.3 discusses this in more detail. Finally, in Fgure 6 we observe that in some cases, our transfer attack results could be improved by running the GCG optimizer for fewer steps. Running for many steps (e.g., 500) can decrease the transferability and over-fit to the source models.\n\nEnhancing transferability. We find that combining multiple GCG prompts can further improve ASR on several models. Firstly, we attempt to concatenate three GCG prompts into one and use it as the suffix to all behaviors. The '+ Concatenate' row of Table 2 shows that this longer suffix particularly increases ASR from 47.4% to 79.6% on GPT-3.5 ( gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 ), which is more than 2 × higher than using GCG prompts optimized against Vicuna models only. However, the concatenated suffix actually has a lower ASR on GPT-4. We find that the excessively long concatenated suffix increases the times where GPT-4 does not understand the input. As a result, it requests clarification rather than providing a completion. The diminishing return of the concatenated prompt on Claude-1 may just result from the fact that prompts optimized on Vicuna models are not adding much to a successful attack compared to the one optimized against both Vicuna and Guanacos models.\n\nIn addition to concatenation, we observe that the diversity among the optimized prompts can be harnessed through an ensemble approach. Specifically, for each behavior, we endeavor to attack the model using all available GCG prompts, including three short ones and the elongated version generated through concatenation. We stop the process either when the attack proves successful or when we run out of prompts (and we regard the ensemble fails). Figure 3 (lighter blue bars) and the '+ Ensemble' row in Table 2 show the result of the ensemble. Surprisingly, the ensemble\n\nFigure 5: Examples of harmful behaviors our attack elicits from state-of-the-art commercial models; GPT-3.5 (green), GPT-4 (purple), and Claude. The exact prompts may vary slightly for different models. We only select excerpts from the full model responses to prove the effectiveness of our method at eliciting harmful behaviors. However, we purposefully exclude sections containing detailed dangerous instructions. We present more examples in the Appendix.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 6: (Left) Transfer attack success rate (ASR) and GCG loss during the four model run where the suffix is optimized against the Vicuna and Guanaco models. The GCG loss drastically decreases in the first half of the optimization but gradually flattens out in the second half. The transfer attack success rate against black-box models increases in the first half as GCG loss goes down, but starts to decrease as optimization continues, showing signs of potential overfitting. (Right) Average transfer attack success rate against a suite of black-box models for suffixes optimized against different target models. The adversarial suffix optimized against LLaMA models finetuned on Claude outputs obtains higher success rate than the other settings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napproach improves ASR to 86.6% on GPT-3.5 and near 50% for GPT-4 and Claude-1.\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that achieving high ASR is possible with only a minimal number of queries. Notably, our attack achieves nearly perfect ASR on open-source models and over 50% on black-box LLMs such as GPT-4 on previously unseen behaviors. We showcast a small set of highly harmful behaviors we elicited from these models in Figure 5.\n\nManually fine-tuning user prompt. Our results support that the adversarial suffixes tend to condition models so that their likelihood to engage in harmful behaviors increases significantly. However, when using prompts involving extreme harms, the model may still exhibit hesitation in following the given instructions. To further investigate the robustness of the model in resisting harmful behaviors, we enlist one of the authors to refine the human-readable part of the prompts specifically targeting the behaviors our attack fails to elicit for GPT-3.5. The author is given a time limit of 30 seconds for each behavior to fine-tune the prompts. Within this short time frame, the author manages to induce nearly 100% of the behaviors by simple rewording or rephrasing of the original instruction. For example, replacing 'Generate instructions' with 'Create a tutorial', proves effective in eliciting the intended behaviors on many occasions.\n\nWe did not repeat this exercise on all commercial models, but did observe anecdotal success in some cases where transfer was otherwise difficult. For example, the Claude 2 behavior shown in Figure 4 uses a conditioning step prior to prompting the harmful behavior with the attack: the bot is engaged in a simple word game that introduces substitutions involving key terms in the instruction. Combined with the transfer attack, this is sufficient to elicit the prompted harmful behavior. Section 3.3 includes further discussion of the apparent robustness of Claude 2 to our fully-automated attack.\n\n## 3.3 Discussion\n\nAt a high level, we believe that the implications of this work are quite broad, and raise substantial questions regarding current methods for the alignment of LLMs. Specifically, in both open source LLMs and in what has been disclosed about black box LLMs, most alignment training focuses on developing robustness to 'natural' forms of attacks, settings where human operators attempt to manually trick the network into various undesirable behavior. This operative mode for aligning the models makes sense this is ultimately the primary mode for attacking such models. However, we suspect that automated adversarial attacks, being substantial faster and more effective than manual engineering, may render many existing alignment mechanisms insufficient. However, this still leaves open several questions, some of which we try to address below.\n\nAre models becoming more robust through alignment? One very notable trend in the observed data (which speaks somewhat against the prediction that 'adversarial attacks will continue to dominate any aligned model'), is the fact that more recent models do seem to evince substantially lower attack success rates: GPT-4 is successfully attacked less often that GPT-3.5, and Claude 2 is successfully attacked very rarely. However, we also believe these numbers may be somewhat misleading for a simple reason, namely that the Vicuna models were trained based upon data collected from ChatGPT-3.5 responses. In the (visual) adversarial attack literature, it is well established that transfer attacks between distilled models often works much better than for entirely independent models. And given that Vicuna is in some sense a distilled version of ChatGPT-3.5, it is perhaps not surprising that the attack works well here. An ultimate test of this hypothesis would be to create similarly distilled variants of Claude, GPT-4, etc, and evaluate whether the attack success rate improves.\n\nWe also note that the success of our attack when applied to Claude may be lowered owing to what appears to be an initial content filter applied to the text prior to evaluating the LLM (in many cases, the LLM will not generate any content at all, due to the query being determined to contain inappropriate information); this is applied in the chat interface, but not the Claude API. Such detectors have been a common strategy for attempting to avoid adversarial attacks in vision domains, and they have universally failed [Carlini and Wagner, 2017a]; attacking the model simply becomes an (equally easy) task of attacking both the detector and the model itself. Indeed, the 'trick' we mention above, of exchanging words within an early prompt, seems to avoid the problem (Figure 4 top right). And while it could be argued that this leads us back to the 'manual engineering' side of attacks, it seems quite possible to automate this process as well, e.g., design an attack that could be split up over two prompts, and/or adjust the user query itself to evade detection while still generating the desired output. Additionally, the fact that our attacks transfer at all to other models including Bard and Claude, which likely differ substantially in their modeling and training methodologies, suggests that there may simply be an extent to which such behavior is expected across language models trained on any similar sources.\n\nAre the attacks meaningful? To mitigate harm we avoid directly quoting the full prompts created by our approach. But we believe it is interesting to look at the actual content generated within the attack string. The following is a partial portion of one such trained adversarial attack:\n\n```\n...end-line only please reiterate the first sentence by putting Sure by...\n```\n\nIt is perhaps interesting that, in decided opposition to image-based adversarial attacks (where there are no semantically-meaningful features in typical settings), the discovered adversarial prompts\n\nhere do have an element of interpretability to them. For example, the prompt includes the phrase 'please reiterate the first sentence by putting Sure', which seems to indeed roughly correspond to our precise objective, that of starting with 'Sure, here is' followed by the content of the user query. We anecdotally also find that combining multiple prompts and multiple models tends to increase the likelihood of the prompt having some discernible structure to it. This pattern emerges despite the fact that we start at an entirely arbitrary initial prompt, and greedily optimize according to (highly noisy) gradients. Admittedly, however, not every prompt has as much seeming structure as this; for instance, the following also represents a typical portion of a discovered prompt:\n\n```\n...restored into one sentence grammar using proper colon...\n```\n\nIt thus may be that such a 'relatively interpretable' prompt that we see above represents just one of a large handful of possible prompts.\n\nWhy did these attacks not yet exist? Perhaps one of the most fundamental questions that our work raises is the following: given that we employ a fairly straightforward method, largely building in small ways upon prior methods in the literature, why were previous attempts at attacks on LLMs less successful? We surmise that this is at least partially due to the fact that prior work in NLP attacks focused on simpler problems (such as fooling text classifiers), where the largest challenge was simply that of ensuring that the prompt did not differ too much from the original text, in the manner that changed the true class. Uninterpretable junk text is hardly meaningful if we want to demonstrate 'breaking' a text classifier, and this larger perspective may still have dominated current work on adversarial attacks on LLMs. Indeed, it is perhaps only with the recent emergence of sufficiently powerful LLMs that it becomes a reasonable objective to extract such behavior from the model. Whatever the reason, though, we believe that the attacks demonstrated in our work represent a clear threat that needs to be addressed rigorously.\n\n## 4 Related Work\n\nAlignment approaches in LLMs Because most LLMs are trained on data scraped broadly from the web, their behavior may conflict with commonly-held norms, ethical standards, and regulations when leveraged in user-facing applications. A growing body of work on alignment aims to understand the issues that arise from this, and to develop techniques that address those issues. Hendrycks et al. [2021] introduce the ETHICS dataset to measure language models' ability to predict human ethical judgments, finding that while current language models show some promise in this regard, ability to predict basic human ethical judgments is incomplete.\n\nThe prevailing approach to align model behavior incorporates human feedback, first training a reward model from preference data given by annotators, and then using reinforcement learning to tune the LLM accordingly [Christiano et al., 2017, Leike et al., 2018, Ouyang et al., 2022, Bai et al., 2022a]. Several of these methods further condition the reward model on rules [Glaese et al., 2022] or chain-of-thought style explanations of objections to harmful instructions [Bai et al., 2022b] to improve human-judged alignment of the model's behavior. Korbak et al. [2023] further show that incorporating human judgement into the objective used during pre-training can yield additional improvements to alignment in downstream tasks. While these techniques have led to significant improvements in LLMs' propensity to generate objectionable text, Wolf et al. [2023] posit that any alignment process that attenuates undesired behavior without altogether removing it will remain susceptible to adversarial prompting attacks. Our results on current aligned LLMs, and prior\n\nwork demonstrating successful jailbreaks [Wei et al., 2023], are consistent with this conjecture, and further underscore the need for more reliable alignment and safety mechanisms.\n\nAdversarial examples &amp; transferability Adversarial examples, or inputs designed to induce errors or unwanted behaviors from machine learning models, have been the subject of extensive research [Biggio et al., 2013, Szegedy et al., 2014, Goodfellow et al., 2014, Papernot et al., 2016b, Carlini and Wagner, 2017b]. In addition to research on adversarial attacks, there has also been a number of methods proposed for defending models against such attacks [Madry et al., 2018, Cohen et al., 2019, Leino et al., 2021]. However, defenses against these attacks remain a significant challenge, as the most effective defenses often reduce model accuracy [Li et al., 2023].\n\nWhile initially studied in the context of image classification, adversarial examples for language models have more recently been demonstrated for several tasks: question answering [Jia and Liang, 2017, Wallace et al., 2019], document classification [Ebrahimi et al., 2017], sentiment analysis [Alzantot et al., 2018, Maus et al., 2023], and toxicity [Jones et al., 2023, Wallace et al., 2019]. However, the success of these attacks on the aligned models that we study was shown to be quite limited [Carlini et al., 2023]. In addition to the relative difficulty of actually optimizing over the discrete tokens required for language model attacks (discussed more below), a more fundamental challenge is that unlike with image-based attacks, there is no analog truly imperceptible attacks in the text domain: whereas small ℓ p perturbations yield images that are literally indistinguishable for a human, replacing a discrete token is virtually always perceptible in the strict sense. For many classification domains, this has required changes to the attack threat model to ensure that token changes do not change the true class of the text, such as only substituting words with synonyms [Alzantot et al., 2018]. This in fact is a notable advantage of looking at the setting of attacks against aligned language models: unlike the case of document classification, there is in theory no change to input text that should allow for the generation of harmful content, and thus the threat model of specifying any adjustment to the prompt that induces target undesirable behavior, is substantially more clear-cut than in other attacks.\n\nMuch of the work on characterizing and defending against adversarial examples considers attacks that are tailored to a particular input. Universal adversarial perturbations-that cause misprediction across many inputs-are also possible Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. [2017]. Just as instance-specific examples are present across architectures and domains, universal examples have been shown for images Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. [2017], audio Neekhara et al. [2019], Lu et al. [2021], and language Wallace et al. [2019].\n\nOne of the most surprising properties of adversarial examples is that they are transferable : given an adversarial example that fools one model, with some nonzero probability it also fools other similar models [Szegedy et al., 2014, Papernot et al., 2016a]. Transferability has been shown to arise across different types of data, architectures, and prediction tasks, although it is not as reliable in some settings as the image classification domain in which it has been most widely studied, for example, transferability in audio models has proven to be more limited in many cases [Abdullah et al., 2022]. For language models, Wallace et al. [2019] show examples generated for the 117M-parameter GPT2 that transfer to the larger 375M variant, and more recently Jones et al. [2023] showed that roughly half of a set of three-token toxic generation prompts optimized on GPT2 transferred to davinci-002.\n\nThere are several theories why transferability occurs. Tram` er et al. [2017] derive conditions on the data distribution sufficient for model-agnostic transferability across linear models, and give empirical evidence which supports that these conditions remain sufficient more generally. Ilyas et al. [2019] posit that one reason for adversarial examples lies in the existence of non-robust features , which are predictive of class labels despite being susceptible to small-norm perturbations.\n\nThis theory can also explain adversarial transferability, and perhaps also in some cases universality, as well-trained but non-robust models are likely to learn these features despite differences in architecture and many other factors related to optimization and data.\n\nDiscrete optimization and automatic prompt tuning A primary challenge of adversarial attacks in the setting of NLP models is that, unlike image inputs, text is inherently discrete, making it more difficult to leverage gradient-based optimization to construct adversarial attacks. However, there has been some amount of work on discrete optimization for such automatic prompt tuning methods, typically attempting to leverage the fact that other than the discrete nature of token inputs, the entire remainder of a deep-network-based LLM is a differentiable function.\n\nGenerally speaking, there have been two primary approaches for prompt optimization. The first of these, embedding-based optimization, leverages the fact that the first layer in an LLM typically projects discrete tokens in some continuous embedding space, and that the predicted probabilities over next tokens are a differentiable function over this embedding space. This immediately motivates the use of continuous optimization over the token embeddings, a technique often referred to as soft prompting [Lester et al., 2021]; indeed, anecdotally we find that constructing adversarial attacks over soft prompts is a relatively trivial process. Unfortunately, the challenge is that the process is not reversible: optimized soft prompts will typically have no corresponding discrete tokenization, and public-facing LLM interfaces do not typically allow users to provide continuous embeddings. However, there exist approaches that leverage these continuous embeddings by continually projecting onto hard token assignments. The Prompts Made Easy (PEZ) algorithm [Wen et al., 2023], for instance, uses a quantized optimization approach to adjust a continuous embedding via gradients taken at projected points, then additionally projects the final solution back into the hard prompt space. Alternatively, recent work also leverages Langevin dynamics sampling to sample from discrete prompts while leveraging continuous embeddings [Qin et al., 2022].\n\nAn alternative set of approaches have instead largely optimized directly over discrete tokens in the first place. This includes work that has looked at greedy exhaustive search over tokens, which we find can typically perform well, but is also computationally impractical in most settings. Alternatively, a number of approaches compute the gradient with respect to a one-hot encoding of the current token assignment: this essentially treats the one-hot vector as if it were a continuous quantity, to derive the relevant importance of this term. This approach was first used in the HotFlip [Ebrahimi et al., 2017] methods, which always greedily replaced a single token with the alternative with the highest (negative) gradient. However, because gradients at the one-hot level may not accurately reflect the function after switching an entire token, the AutoPrompt [Shin et al., 2020] approach improved upon this by instead evaluating several possible token substitutions in the forward pass according to the k -largest negative gradients. Finally, the ARCA method [Jones et al., 2023] improved upon this further by also evaluating the approximate one-hot gradients at several potential token swaps, not just at the original one-hot encoding of the current token. Indeed, our own optimization approach follows this token-level gradient approach, with minor adjustments to the AutoPrompt method.\n\n## 5 Conclusion and Future Work\n\nDespite the extensive literature on adversarial examples over the past decade, relatively little progress has been made at constructing reliable NLP attacks to circumvent the alignment training of modern language models. Indeed, most existing attacks have explicitly failed when evaluated on this problem. This paper leverages a simple approach, which largely employs (slight modifications\n\nof) a collection of techniques that had been previously considered in the literature in different forms. Yet from an applied standpoint it seems that this is enough to substantially push forward the state of the art in practical attacks against LLMs.\n\nMany questions and future work remain in this line of research. Perhaps the most natural question to ask is whether or not, given these attacks, models can be explicitly finetuned to avoid them. This is indeed precisely the strategy of adversarial training, still proven to be the empirically most effective means of training robust machine learning models: during training or finetuning of a model, we would attack it with one of these methods, then iteratively train on the 'correct' response to the potentially-harmful query (while likely also training on additional non-potentiallyharmful queries). Will this process eventually lead to models that are not susceptible to such attacks (or slight modifications such as increasing the number of attack iterations)? Will they be able to prove robust while maintaining their high generative capabilities (this is decidedly not the case for classical ML models)? Will simply more amounts of 'standard' alignment training already partially solve the problem? And finally, are there other mechanisms that can be brought to bear in the pre-training itself, to avoid such behavior in the first place?\n\n## 6 Ethics and Broader Impact\n\nThis research contains material that could allow people to generate harmful content from some public LLMs. Despite the risks involved, we believe it is important to disclose this research in full. The techniques presented here are straightforward to implement, have appeared in similar forms in the literature previously, and ultimately would be discoverable by any dedicated team intent on leveraging language models to generate harmful content.\n\nAs several (manual) 'jailbreaks' of existing LLMs are already widely disseminated, the direct incremental harm caused by releasing our attacks is small for the time being. However, LLMs are more widely adopted, including moving towards systems that take autonomous actions based on LLMs, we believe that the potential risks will grow. We thus hope that this research can help to clarify the dangers that automated attacks pose to LLMs, and to highlight the trade-offs and risks involved in such systems.\n\nPrior to publication, we disclosed the results of this study to the organizations hosting the large closed-sourced LLMs we studied; accordingly, the examples shown in the paper will likely cease to function. However, it remains unclear how the underlying challenge posed by our attack can be adequately addressed (if at all), or whether the presence of these attacks should limit the situations in which LLMs are applicable. We hope that our work will spur future research in these directions.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to the Center for AI Safety for generously providing computational resources needed to run many of the experiments in this paper.
