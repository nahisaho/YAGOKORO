Transitions of this chain are learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the data in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of small amounts of Gaussian noise, it is sufficient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional Gaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization.\n\nDiffusion models are straightforward to define and efficient to train, but to the best of our knowledge, there has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We show that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes better than the published results on other types of generative models (Section 4).",

We obtained our best sample quality results using this parameterization (Section 4.2), so we consider this equivalence to be one of our primary contributions.\n\nDespite their sample quality, our models do not have competitive log likelihoods compared to other likelihood-based models (our models do, however, have log likelihoods better than the large estimates annealed importance sampling has been reported to produce for energy based models and score matching [11, 55]).",

In particular, our diffusion process setup in Section 4 causes the simplified objective to down-weight loss terms corresponding to small t . These terms train the network to denoise data with very small amounts of noise, so it is beneficial to down-weight them so that the network can focus on more difficult denoising tasks at larger t terms.

Our progressive decoding argument can be seen in convolutional DRAW and related models [18, 40] and may also lead to more general designs for subscale orderings or sampling strategies for autoregressive models [38, 64].",

Since diffusion models seem to have excellent inductive biases for image data, we look forward to investigating their utility in other data modalities and as components in other types of generative models and machine learning systems.",

Our paper represents progress in making diffusion models a generally useful tool in this family of techniques, so it may serve to amplify any impacts that generative models have had (and will have) on the broader world.\n\nUnfortunately, there are numerous well-known malicious uses of generative models. Sample generation techniques can be employed to produce fake images and videos of high profile figures for political purposes. While fake images were manually created long before software tools were available, generative models such as ours make the process easier. Fortunately, CNN-generated images currently have subtle flaws that allow detection [62], but improvements in generative models may make this more difficult.",

Fortunately, CNN-generated images currently have subtle flaws that allow detection [62], but improvements in generative models may make this more difficult. Generative models also reflect the biases in the datasets on which they are trained. As many large datasets are collected from the internet by automated systems, it can be difficult to remove these biases, especially when the images are unlabeled. If samples from generative models trained on these datasets proliferate throughout the internet, then these biases will only be reinforced further.\n\nOn the other hand, diffusion models may be useful for data compression, which, as data becomes higher resolution and as global internet traffic increases, might be crucial to ensure accessibility of the internet to wide audiences.",

We set T = 1000 without a sweep, and we chose a linear schedule from β 1 = 10 -4 to β T = 0 . 02 .\n- We set the dropout rate on CIFAR10 to 0 . 1 by sweeping over the values { 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 3 , 0 . 4 } . Without dropout on CIFAR10, we obtained poorer samples reminiscent of the overfitting artifacts in an unregularized PixelCNN++ [52]. We set dropout rate on the other datasets to zero without sweeping.\n- We used random horizontal flips during training for CIFAR10; we tried training both with and without flips, and found flips to improve sample quality slightly.",

Sample quality scores and log likelihood are reported on the minimum FID value over the course of training. On CIFAR10, we calculated Inception and FID scores on 50000 samples using the original code from the OpenAI [51] and TTUR [21] repositories, respectively. On LSUN, we calculated FID scores on 50000 samples using code from the StyleGAN2 [30] repository. CIFAR10 and CelebA-HQ were loaded as provided by TensorFlow Datasets ( https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets ), and LSUN was prepared using code from StyleGAN.

In greater detail:\n\n1. We use a U-Net with self-attention; NCSN uses a RefineNet with dilated convolutions. We condition all layers on t by adding in the Transformer sinusoidal position embedding, rather than only in normalization layers (NCSNv1) or only at the output (v2).\n2. Diffusion models scale down the data with each forward process step (by a √ 1 -β t factor) so that variance does not grow when adding noise, thus providing consistently scaled inputs to the neural net reverse process. NCSN omits this scaling factor.\n3. Unlike NCSN, our forward process destroys signal ( D KL ( q ( x T | x 0 ) ‖ N ( 0 , I )) ≈ 0 ), ensuring a close match between the prior and aggregate posterior of x T .",

Unlike NCSN, our forward process destroys signal ( D KL ( q ( x T | x 0 ) ‖ N ( 0 , I )) ≈ 0 ), ensuring a close match between the prior and aggregate posterior of x T . Also unlike NCSN, our β t are very small, which ensures that the forward process is reversible by a Markov chain with conditional Gaussians. Both of these factors prevent distribution shift when sampling.\n4. Our Langevin-like sampler has coefficients (learning rate, noise scale, etc.) derived rigorously from β t in the forward process. Thus, our training procedure directly trains our sampler to match the data distribution after T steps: it trains the sampler as a latent variable model using variational inference. In contrast, NCSN's sampler coefficients are set by hand post-hoc, and their training procedure is not guaranteed to directly optimize a quality metric of their sampler.",

To understand the significance of the second source of noise, we sampled multiple images conditioned on the same intermediate latent for the CelebA 256 × 256 dataset. Figure 7 shows multiple draws from the reverse process x 0 ∼ p θ ( x 0 | x t ) that share the latent x t for t ∈ { 1000 , 750 , 500 , 250 } . To accomplish this, we run a single reverse chain from an initial draw from the prior. At the intermediate timesteps, the chain is split to sample multiple images.

This indicates that intermediate latents like x 750 encode these attributes, despite their imperceptibility.\n\nCoarse-to-fine interpolation Figure 9 shows interpolations between a pair of source CelebA 256 × 256 images as we vary the number of diffusion steps prior to latent space interpolation. Increasing the number of diffusion steps destroys more structure in the source images, which the\n\nmodel completes during the reverse process.
