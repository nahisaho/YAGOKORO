    "abstract": "This paper addresses the growing need for efficient large language models (LLMs) on mobile devices, driven by increasing cloud costs and latency concerns. We focus on designing top-quality LLMs with fewer than a billion parameters, a practical choice for mobile deployment. Contrary to prevailing belief emphasizing the pivotal role of data and parameter quantity in determining model quality, our investigation underscores the significance of model architecture for sub-billion scale LLMs. Leveraging deep and thin architectures, coupled with embedding sharing and grouped-query attention mechanisms, we establish a strong baseline network denoted as MobileLLM, which attains a remarkable 2.7%/4.3% accuracy boost over preceding 125M/350M state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we propose an immediate block-wise weight-sharing approach with no increase in model size and only marginal latency overhead. The resultant models, denoted as MobileLLM-LS, demonstrate a further accuracy enhancement of 0.7%/0.8% than MobileLLM 125M/350M. Moreover, MobileLLM model family shows significant improvements compared to previous sub-billion models on chat benchmarks, and demonstrates close correctness to LLaMA-v2 7B in API calling tasks, highlighting the capability of small models for common on-device use cases.",

In the current landscape of mobile technology, integrating an LLM like the LLaMAv2 7B (Touvron et al., 2023b) with 8-bit weights proves prohibitively expensive due to limitations in main-memory (DRAM) capacity source.

A prevalent memory hierarchy in mobile devices is depicted in Figure 2. With DRAM capacities ranging from 6 GB for the iPhone 15 and 12 GB for the Google Pixel 8 Pro (Hristov, 2022; Google, 2023), a mobile app should not exceed 10% of the DRAM, since DRAM is shared with the operating system and other applications (Malladi et al., 2012). This motivates deploying sub-billion parameter LLMs. Additionally, factoring in LLM energy consumption (0.1 J/token per billion in model parameters (Han et al., 2016; Malladi et al., 2012)), a 7Bparameter LLM consumes 0.7 J/token. A fully charged iPhone, with approximately 50kJ of energy, can sustain this model in conversation for less than 2 hours at a rate of 10 tokens/s, with every 64 tokens draining 0.2% of the battery.\n\nless than 1 billion.",

The input embedding in LLM models maps the token ID in the vocabulary to the corresponding token embedding and has a dimension of ( vocab \\_ size, embedding \\_ dim ) .

The results presented in Table 5 showcase that MobileLLM models significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art sub-billion scale models, surpassing even models with 1 billion parameters. Notably, MobileLLM-LS -350M achieves a remarkable win rate of 48.2% when compared to the baseline GPT-3 model (text-davinci-001).

Despite lower Rouge scores in MobileLLM -350M compared to 7B models, it is crucial to note that API calling prioritizes correct API invocation. The results suggest that certain common scenarios in on-device applications are not particularly challenging, and smaller models like MobileLLM -350M can adeptly handle it.",

These methods include:\n\nModel Compression. Numerous model compression methods are developed for LLMs, including pruning(Xia et al., 2023b), sparsity (Sun et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2023a; Frantar &amp; Alistarh, 2023), and quantization (Liu et al., 2023a; Dettmers et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023; Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023c;b; Frantar et al., 2022).

A limited number of studies have explored compact model architectures, such as TinyLLaMA (Timiryasov &amp; Tastet, 2023). However, even the smallest TinyLLaMA exceeds 1 billion parameters, making them still prohibitive for many on-device applications. Some research proposes large model architectures alongside their smaller LLM variants in a model family (Zhang et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Dey et al., 2023) or an analytical suite containing small LLM variants (Biderman et al., 2023).

NAS has garnered substantial attention in the realm of convolutional neural networks, particularly in the context of vision tasks (Tan &amp; Le, 2019; Zoph &amp; Le, 2016; Wu et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020). In contrast, within the transformer domain, the prevailing consensus posits that the model architecture exerts minimal influence on accuracy, provided the total number of parameters remains consistent (Kaplan et al., 2020). Only a limited number of studies have developed NAS algorithms for language transformers, targeting at BERT models (Xu et al., 2021; Jawahar et al., 2023; Ganesan et al., 2021). Our current investigation, focusing on the interplay between depth and width, can be conceptualized as a meticulous grid search within the depth space.",

Weight sharing is an intuitive strategy for optimizing model weight utilization within fixed parameter constraints. While the OPT family (Zhang et al., 2022) and subsequent works (Black et al., 2022) leverage weight sharing between input and output embeddings, limited research has explored weight sharing for intermediate layers in transformers (Shen et al., 2022; Reid et al., 2021).

In the realm of efficient transformer design, much research has focused on optimizing attention computation through methods like lowrank approximation (Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021) and sparse attention (Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021).

Looking at the results in Table 10, transitioning from the traditional Feedforward Network ( FC → ReLU → FC ) to SwiGLU yields an accuracy improvement of 1.3% for both model sizes. Further increasing the model depth enhances accuracy by 0.9%/1.1% for 125M/350M models, respectively. Then, introducing input and output embedding sharing achieves a parameter reduction of approximately 10%, while with only marginal accuracy drops of 0.2% for 125M and 0.6% for 350M models. Additionally, following in findings in Section D, we incorporate grouped query attention with a head dimension equal to 64, and a head number to near 4 × to the kv-head number, while increasing the embedding dimension to preserve model size. This modification further results in a performance boost of 0.4%/0.7% for 125M/350M models.",

The findings indicate that shallow architectures with fewer than 10 layers perform poorly in reasoning or handling comprehension tasks. Models with 10-20 layers exhibit improved accuracy, while further increasing depth continues to provide significant benefits across all three tasks. Notably, the optimal depth is found to be near 30 layers for sub-billion scale models.",

Our study involves two baseline architectures: an 8-layer 125M model with an embedding dimension of 896, and a 15-layer 350M model with an embedding dimension of 1280. We conduct head size sweeps in {8, 16, 32}. The findings shown in Table 13 indicate that using 16 heads, with a head dimension close to 64, and 4 key-value heads, yields the best accuracy and memory trade-off. This setting serves as a guiding principle in our model architecture design.",

      "content": "This section explores the compatibility of quantization with the proposed model architecture and layer sharing. We employ a straightforward per-token min-max quantization, quantizing both weight and activation to 8-bit using post-training quantization (PTQ). Experiments are conducted on both MobileLLM and MobileLLM-LS with model sizes of 125M and 350M, trained on 0.25T tokens. Results in Table 15 demonstrate that W8A8 PTQ results in a modest accuracy drop of within 0.5% and is compatible with the proposed layer-sharing method.",

We focus on designing top-quality LLMs with fewer than a billion parameters, a practical choice for mobile deployment. Contrary to prevailing belief emphasizing the pivotal role of data and parameter quantity in determining model quality, our investigation underscores the significance of model architecture for sub-billion scale LLMs. Leveraging deep and thin architectures, coupled with embedding sharing and grouped-query attention mechanisms, we establish a strong baseline network denoted as MobileLLM , which attains a remarkable 2.7%/4.3% accuracy boost over preceding 125M/350M state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we propose an immediate block-wise weightsharing approach with no increase in model size and only marginal latency overhead. The resultant models, denoted as MobileLLM-LS , demonstrate a further accuracy enhancement of 0.7%/0.8% than MobileLLM 125M/350M. Moreover, MobileLLM model family shows significant improvements compared to previous subbillion models on chat benchmarks, and demonstrates close correctness to LLaMA-v2 7B in API calling tasks, highlighting the capability of small models for common on-device use cases.\n\n## 1.

In the current landscape of mobile technology, integrating an LLM like the LLaMAv2 7B (Touvron et al., 2023b) with 8-bit weights proves prohibitively expensive due to limitations in main-memory (DRAM) capacity source. A prevalent memory hierarchy in mobile devices is depicted in Figure 2. With DRAM capacities ranging from 6 GB for the iPhone 15 and 12 GB for the Google Pixel 8 Pro (Hristov, 2022; Google, 2023), a mobile app should not exceed 10% of the DRAM, since DRAM is shared with the operating system and other applications (Malladi et al., 2012). This motivates deploying sub-billion parameter LLMs. Additionally, factoring in LLM energy consumption (0.1 J/token per billion in model parameters (Han et al., 2016; Malladi et al., 2012)), a 7Bparameter LLM consumes 0.7 J/token. A fully charged iPhone, with approximately 50kJ of energy, can sustain this model in conversation for less than 2 hours at a rate of 10 tokens/s, with every 64 tokens draining 0.2% of the battery.\n\nless than 1 billion.\n\nWe make the following contributions to build the most accurate LLMs to date under 1 billion parameters. 6\n\n- Contradictory to the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), we demonstrate that depth is more important than width for small LLMs. A deep-and-thin model structure excels in capturing abstract concepts, resulting in superior final performance.\n- We revisit embedding sharing methods (Zhang et al., 2022) and implement grouped query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023) in small LLMs to maximize weight utilization.\n- OBQA WinoGrande Avg. 33.0 51.7 43.9 33.5 51.2 43.6 35.5 51.7 43.2 37.9 51.0 44.7 · We propose immediate block-wise weight sharing.

Improving Sub-billion Scale LLM Design\n\nThese demands converge on a singular imperative: the adoption of compact models for on-device execution. By utilizing a sub-billion model, such as a 350M 8-bit model consuming only 0.035 J/token, an iPhone can support conversational use an entire day. Moreover, the decoding speed can be significantly enhanced, as exemplified by the benchmark results of the 125M model, capable of operating at 50 tokens/s, compared to the state-of-the-art iPhone App MLC Chat utilizing the LLaMA 7B model at 3 ∼ 6 tokens/second 5 . In light of these considerations, our paper is motivated by the design and implementation of LLMs with parameters\n\n49.2\n\nIn this section, we present the evolutionary path from a baseline sub-billion parameter model to the new state-ofthe-art models (Figure 3). We explore both 125M and 350M models and demonstrate consistent improvements in both cases. For on-device use cases where model size is a major constraint, how to allocate the limited weight parameters effectively becomes more critical than ever. We first propose a strong baseline model named MobileLLM by testing out four model design techniques that are beneficial for subbillion scale LLMs, including (1) adopting SwiGLU FFN (Dauphin et al., 2017); (2) forcing lanky (deep and thin) architectures (3) revisiting embedding sharing method (Zhang et al., 2022) (4) utilizing grouped query attention (Chowdhery et al., 2023).

The ensuing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions would present staggering environmental challenges. Consequently, it is imperative that we downsize LLMs.\n\nFigure 3: Design roadmap of sub-billion sized transformer models. The foreground and background bars represent the averaged accuracy on zero-shot common sense reasoning tasks for 125M and 350M models, respectively. The 125M model, initially a 12-layer 768-dimension structure, is enhanced via improving feed-forward network design, network depth adjustments, and weight-sharing strategies. The detailed accuracy of each modification can be found in the appendix.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nslight latency overhead in the memory-bounded LM decoding process. We denote our model with layer sharing as MobileLLM-LS .\n\n## 2.1. Training Setup\n\nOur experiments are conducted on 32 A100 GPUs, with each GPU having a batch size of 32. We performed exploratory experiments with 120k iterations on 0.25T tokens. Subsequently, the top models reported in Table 3 and Table 4, are trained with 480k iterations on 1T tokens.\n\nWe evaluate the pre-trained model on zero-shot common sense reasoning tasks, including ARC-easy, ARCchallenge (Clark et al., 2018), BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), SIQA (Sap et al., 2019), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), OBQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), as well as question answering and reading comprehension tasks using TQA (Joshi et al., 2017) and RACE dataset (Lai et al., 2017).\n\n## 2.2. Building a Strong Baseline\n\n## 2.2.1. FEED-FORWARD NETWORK CHOICE\n\nWe first investigate activation functions commonly used in feed-forward networks (FFNs) and find that the state-ofthe-art SwiGLU (Dauphin et al., 2017) is also beneficial for small models. By changing the vanilla FFN ( FC → ReLU → FC ) to SwiGLU, The average performance on zero-shot reasoning tasks is boosted from 42.6 to 43.9 for the 125M model. Therefore, we use SwiGLU in FFN for the experiments afterward.\n\n## 2.2.2. ARCHITECTURE DEPTH VS WIDTH\n\nA prevalent belief (Kaplan et al., 2020) in the field suggests that the performance of transformer models is primarily determined by the number of parameters, the size of the training dataset, and the number of training iterations. This belief posits that architectural designs have negligible impact on the transformer model's performance. However, our findings indicate that this may not hold true for smaller models.\n\nOur experimental results, specifically for small models with limited model capacity, reveals that going deeper is more crucial than going wider for performance improvement. We conducted an extensive study involving the training of 19 models, including 9 models with ∼ 125M parameters and 10 models with ∼ 350M parameters. Each model is designed with a similar size but varied in terms of depth and width. We experiment on eight zero-shot common sense reasoning tasks, as well as question answering and reading comprehension benchmarks. Our findings consistently demonstrate that deeper and thinner models outperform their shallower and wider counterparts. Figure 4 (a) and (b) illustrate the superior performance of deeper networks across most zero-shot reasoning tasks, including ARC-easy, ARC-challenge, PIQA, HellaSwag, OBQA, WinoGrande. Particularly, this trend is even more pronounced on the TQA and RACE datasets, as shown in Figure 4 (c)-(f). Detailed model configurations and results can be seen in the appendix. Our findings suggest that models with 30 or even 42 layers perform significantly better than those with 12 layers for transformer models sized around 125M. This finding is surprising considering the number of layers in most previous 125M models (Zhang et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022) is limited to 12.\n\n## 2.2.3. EMBEDDING SHARING\n\nIn sub-billion scale language models, the embedding layers constitute a significant portion of the parameter count. For instance, with an embedding dimension of 512 and a vocabulary size of 32k, the input and output embedding layers each comprise 16 million parameters. Together, these embedding layers account for more than 20% of the total parameters of a 125M-parameter model. Contrastingly, this proportion is considerably lower in larger language models. For example, the input and output embeddings only account for 3.7% of the total number of parameters in the LLaMA7B model (Touvron et al., 2023a) and a mere 0.7% in the\n\nFigure 4: Under comparable model sizes, deeper and thinner models generally outperform their wider and shallower counterparts across various tasks such as zero-shot common sense reasoning, question answering, and reading comprehension.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 1: Ablation study on input-output embedding sharing with a 30-layer model with 512 embedding dimension, on zero-shot common-sense reasoning tasks.

This disparity might elucidate why embedding sharing was initially proposed and implemented in OPT models (Zhang et al., 2022) but was subsequently disregarded in recent designs of LLMs.\n\nIn the development of sub-billion scale language models, we revisit the concept of input-output embedding sharing. The input embedding in LLM models maps the token ID in the vocabulary to the corresponding token embedding and has a dimension of ( vocab \\_ size, embedding \\_ dim ) . Conversely, the output fully-connected layer maps the embedding dimension back to the logits prediction across the vocabulary, with a weight size of ( vocab \\_ size, embedding \\_ dim ) . By sharing the embedding, we reuse the input embedding weights as the output fully connected layer weights, resulting in a more efficient and compact model architecture.\n\nWe experiment on a 30-layer 125M model. In Table 1, we demonstrate that sharing the input and output embeddings reduces the number of parameters by 16M, approximately 11.8% of total parameters with a 0.2 points drop in average accuracy. The marginal accuracy drop can be readily restored by reallocating the saved parameters to add more layers. Increasing the depth to 32 layers produces a 0.4 points accuracy gain while still maintaining 10M fewer parameters compared to the original 135M model. Similar results are also observed in 350M models. These findings further suggest that embedding sharing is a valuable tech-\n\nFigure 5: Ablation study on number of heads and kv-heads. Here, the ratio denotes the number of heads divided by the number of kv-heads. Averaged accuracy on zero-shot reasoning tasks is reported.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnique for maximizing weight utilization and optimizing model performance given a limited model storage budget.\n\n## 2.2.4. NUMBER OF HEADS AND KV-HEADS\n\nWe now investigate the optimal head size for small transformer models. The trade-off between more semantics per head dimension and more non-linear combinations of multiple heads is a key consideration in choosing the head size. In addition, most previous studies have typically used an identical number of key-value heads to query heads in subbillion parameter language models. Instead, we found that grouped query attention, which is initially designed for re-\n\nducing key-value cache size in LLMs (Chowdhery et al., 2023; Ainslie et al., 2023), can also effectively reduce redundancy in key-value heads in small LMs. Grouped query attention can be viewed as another form of weight-sharing for weight re-utilization, where the number of key-value heads is 1 /n that of query heads, and the kv-heads are repeated n times in computing attention scores and output together with the query. Here, n ∈ Z + denotes a positive integer that the number of query heads are divisible by.\n\nTo establish a solid foundation for a state-of-the-art small transformer model, we conducted experiments to determine the desirable head size on 125M and 350M models. Results in Figure 5 show that using 16 query heads produces the best results. Additionally, reducing the number of kv-heads from 16 to 4 resulted in comparable accuracy for the 125M model and only 0.2 points accuracy drop in the 350M model with almost 10% model size reduction. These results serve as a guideline in our model architecture design. By adopting the grouped query attention (GQA) and meanwhile increasing the embedding dimension to maintain the model size, the accuracy of 125M further increases by 0.4 points, indicating GQA as a favorable method to further squeeze out small model's potential.\n\nIn summary, we tested out four state-of-the-art techniques beneficial to small model designs, including FFN with SwiGLU, deep and thin architecture, embedding sharing, and grouped query attention. Combining these techniques, we build a strong baseline small LLM and we name it MobileLLM .\n\n## 2.3. Layer Sharing\n\nThe findings in Section 2.2.2 on the impact of layer depth versus width suggest deeper layers are favorable for small transformer models. This motivates us to investigate layer sharing as a strategy to increase the number of hidden layers without additional model storage cost. This approach is particularly helpful in on-device scenarios where model size is a major constraint.\n\nSurprisingly, the experimental findings show that accuracy enhancement can be achieved by simply replicating transformer blocks, without necessitating architectural modifications or an enlargement of the model size. We further examined three different weight-sharing strategies, illustrated in Figure 6. Results in Table 2 indicate that the repeatover layer-sharing strategy produces the best performance among immediate block-wise repeat, repeat all-over, and reverse sharing strategies. However, considering the hardware memory hierarchy (Figure 2), the SRAM for computing is typically limited to around 20MB. This capacity is usually only sufficient to hold a single transformer block. Therefore, placing shared weights in the cache and computing them twice immediately can avoid the need to transfer weights be-\n\nFigure 6: (a) Baseline model without layer sharing; (b) Immediate block-wise sharing; (c) Repeat-all-over sharing; (d) Reverse sharing. A transformer block contains the multihead self-attention (MHSA) and the feed-forward network (FFN). While repeat-all-over sharing has slightly higher performance, immediate block-wise sharing best utilizes the cache because the shared weights can stay in the cache and be immediately computed twice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntween the SRAM and DRAM, resulting in improved overall execution speed for auto-regressive inference. Consequently, we have opted for the immediate block-wise sharing strategy in our model design. We denote the proposed model with layer sharing as MobileLLM-LS .\n\n## 3. Experiments\n\n## 3.1. Experimental Settings\n\nWe train MobileLLM from scratch using Adam optimizer (Kingma &amp; Ba, 2014) with a weight decay of 0.1. The experiments are conducted using 32 A100 GPUs, with a batch size of 32 on each GPU. The initial learning rate is set to 2e-3 and follows a cosine learning-rate decay strategy. We perform quick exploration experiments with 120k iterations on 0.25T tokens and train the best models reported in Tables 3 and 4 with 480k iterations on 1T tokens.\n\n## 3.2. Main Results\n\nWe compare the final performance on zero-shot common sense reasoning tasks, question answering, and reading comprehension tasks. The results of baseline methods were evaluated using their open-source Hugging Face models to ensure consistent evaluation procedures.\n\nZero-shot Common Sense Reasoning Table 3 presents a comparison between our proposed model, MobileLLM , and state-of-the-art sub-billion parameter models, including the early open-sourced LLMs, OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), and recent releases such as\n\nTable 2: Ablation study of layer-sharing strategy on zero-shot common sense reasoning tasks.\n\n| Model   | Sharing method             |   ARC-e |   ARC-c |   BoolQ |   PIQA |   SIQA |   HellaSwag |   OBQA |   WinoGrande |   Avg. |\n|---------|----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|--------------|--------|\n| 125M    | baseline                   |    41.6 |    25.7 |    61.1 |   62.4 |   43.1 |        34.4 |   36.9 |         51.6 |   44.6 |\n| 125M    | Immediate block-wise share |    43.9 |    27.9 |    61.5 |   64.3 |   41.5 |        35.5 |   35.1 |         50.2 |   45   |\n| 125M    | Repeat-all-over share      |    43.6 |    27.1 |    60.7 |   63.4 |   42.6 |        35.5 |   36.9 |         51.7 |   45.2 |\n| 125M    | Reverse share              |    43.8 |    26   |    58.9 |   62.9 |   42.2 |        35.2 |   36.8 |         52.2 |   44.8 |\n| 350M    | baseline                   |    50.8 |    30.6 |    62.3 |   68.6 |   43.5 |        45.1 |   43.8 |         52.4 |   49.6 |\n| 350M    | Immediate block-wise share |    51.5 |    30.8 |    59.6 |   68.2 |   43.9 |        47.7 |   44.7 |         55   |   50.2 |\n| 350M    | Repeat-all-over share      |    53.5 |    33   |    61.2 |   69.4 |   43.2 |        48.3 |   42.2 |         54.6 |   50.7 |\n| 350M    | Reverse share              |    50.7 |    32.2 |    61   |   68.8 |   43.8 |        47.4 |   43.1 |         53.8 |   50.1 |\n\nTable 3: Zero-shot performance on Common Sense Reasoning tasks.

Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) and transformer variants RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) on zero-shot common sense reasoning tasks. For the 125M model size, MobileLLM favorably outperforms previous models such as OPT, GPT-Neo, and Galactica at the same model size by a significant margin. Additionally, MobileLLM -125M achieves 3.8 points and 2.7 points higher accuracy than Pythia-160M and RWKV169M while being 22% and 26% smaller, respectively. Fur- thermore, incorporating layer-sharing in MobileLLM-LS -125M results in an additional 0.7 points improvement in accuracy. It is noteworthy that MobileLLM-LS -125M achieves comparable or even higher results than most previous 350M models. In the 350M model size category, MobileLLM surpasses previous state-of-the-art models by more than 4 points with comparable or smaller model sizes.\n\nTo further validate our design principles under a wider range of memory constraints, we extend our model to include MobileLLM -600M, 1B, and 1.5B configurations. The comprehensive results are detailed in the Appendix A.\n\nQuestion Answering and Reading Comprehension We evaluate pre-trained models on the TQA question answering benchmark (Joshi et al., 2017) and RACE reading comprehension benchmark (Lai et al., 2017). We follow the evaluation setup from (Touvron et al., 2023a) and report the results in Table 4. Comparing models of 125M size, MobileLLM -125M demonstrates a noteworthy improvement of over 4.3 points on the TQA benchmark in contrast to its predecessor. Moreover, the MobileLLM -350M model exhibits a substantial performance increase of approximately 10 points compared to other 350M-sized models. For the reading comprehension tasks, MobileLLM model family also exhibits significantly higher scores than preceding sub-billion parameter models.\n\nTable 5: Benchmark results on AlpacaEval (Evaluator: GPT4; Reference model: text-davinci-001) and MT-Bench.\n\n| Model                            | MT-Bench (score)                 | Alpaca Eval (win %)              |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| number of parameters < 200M      | number of parameters < 200M      | number of parameters < 200M      |\n| OPT-125M                         | 1.21                             | 3.91                             |\n| GPT-Neo-125M                     | 1.06                             | 1.01                             |\n| Pythia-160M                      | 1.01                             | 0.63                             |\n| MobileLLM -125M                  | 2.33                             | 24.07                            |\n| MobileLLM-LS -125M               | 2.52                             | 23.79                            |\n| 200M < number of parameters < 1B | 200M < number of parameters < 1B | 200M < number of parameters < 1B |\n| OPT-350M                         | 1.37                             | 6.80                             |\n| Pythia-410M                      | 1.62                             | 13.87                            |\n| BLOOM-560M                       | 1.73                             | 10.29                            |\n| MobileLLM -350M                  | 3.28                             | 47.08                            |\n| MobileLLM-LS -350M               | 3.16                             | 48.20                            |\n| number of parameters > 1B        | number of parameters > 1B        | number of parameters > 1B        |\n| Pythia-1B                        | 1.70                             | 16.62                            |\n| BLOOM-1.1B                       | 2.37                             | 19.90                            |\n| Falcon-1.3B                      | 2.54                             | 30.38                            |\n| OPT-1.3B                         | 2.24                             | 38.84                            |\n\n## 3.3. Downstream Tasks\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of sub-billion scale models for on-device applications, we assess their performance in two crucial on-device tasks: Chat and API calling.\n\n## 3.3.1. CHAT\n\nWe fine-tune MobileLLM models, as well as previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) models sourced from HuggingFace checkpoints for chat-based tasks, and evaluate them under identical settings to ensure consistency. We evaluate two benchmarks: AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023), a singlerun chat benchmark, and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), a multi-run chat benchmark. The results presented in Table 5 showcase that MobileLLM models significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art sub-billion scale models, surpassing even models with 1 billion parameters. Notably, MobileLLM-LS -350M achieves a remarkable win rate of 48.2% when compared to the baseline GPT-3 model (text-davinci-001). Considering the self-win rate of GPT-3 is 50%, it is noteworthy that MobileLLM-LS -350M obtains comparable chat performance as this baseline model. Visualizations of chat examples in the appendix also underscore the impressive quality of responses generated by MobileLLM models.\n\n## 3.3.2. API CALLING\n\nAPI calling is a common on-device application, particularly in collaboration with audio-to-text models for assistant functionalities. Leveraging LLMs for API calling involves the conversion of natural language inputs into JSON configura-\n\nTable 6: API calling evaluation score. EMintent /EMstructure measures the exact match in API calling. R1/RL refers to the Rouge-1/-L score measuring the quality of agent response.\n\n| Model           |   EM intent |   EM structure |   R1 |   RL |\n|-----------------|-------------|----------------|------|------|\n| OPT-350M        |        56.1 |           38.6 | 37.1 | 35.3 |\n| Pythia-410M     |        62.2 |           44.7 | 43.1 | 41.1 |\n| BLOOM-560M      |        64.7 |           37.9 | 36.9 | 34.6 |\n| MobileLLM -350M |        65.3 |           48.8 | 46.8 | 44.6 |\n| LLaMA-v2 7B     |        62.8 |           50.9 | 56.5 | 54.3 |\n\ntions to invoke corresponding APIs 7 . For instance, given the input \"Help me set an alarm at 7:30 AM\" the model outputs {API: \"alarm(time=\"7:30 am\")\"} . Additionally, the model generates an agent response: \"Sure! Your alarm is set to 7:30 AM.\"\n\nTo adapt LLMs for this task, we create a synthetic dataset with 5000 training samples and 2500 testing samples. Each sample involves 8 conversation turns on average. Detailed examples of this dataset are provided in the appendix. The pre-trained models undergo fine-tuning on the training set for 4 epochs, utilizing the Adam optimizer with a lineardecay learning rate starting at 2e-5 and a weight decay of 0.01.\n\nTable 6 shows that MobileLLM -350M demonstrates comparable intent and structure exact match scores to LLaMAv2 7B, where high intent scores indicate the correct prediction of the API user intends to call, while structural exact match scores reflect the proficiency in predicting content within API functions. Despite lower Rouge scores in MobileLLM -350M compared to 7B models, it is crucial to note that API calling prioritizes correct API invocation. The results suggest that certain common scenarios in on-device applications are not particularly challenging, and smaller models like MobileLLM -350M can adeptly handle it.\n\n## 3.4. Compatibility with Quantization\n\nWe further conduct per-token min-max post-training quantization (PTQ) experiments on both MobileLLM and MobileLLM-LS models with 125M and 350M model sizes trained on 0.25T tokens. Figure 7 shows that employing W8A8 PTQ yields a modest accuracy reduction of less than 0.5 points and remains compatible with layer sharing.\n\n## 3.5. Knowledge Distillation\n\nSo far, we trained compact models from scratch using next tokens as hard labels. We explored Knowledge Distillation (KD) of 125M and 350M models with LLAMA-v2 7B as\n\n7 https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling\n\nFigure 7: Comparison between BFloat16 model and 8-bit weight 8-bit activation post-training quantized model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 7: Latency analysis of MobileLLM -125M (30 layers), MobileLLM-LS -125M (2 × 30 layers, adjacent blocks sharing weights), and a 60-layer non-shared weight model, with consistent configurations in all other aspects.\n\n|                     | Load    | Init      | Execute   |\n|---------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| MobileLLM           | 39.2 ms | 1361.7 ms | 15.6 ms   |\n| MobileLLM-LS        | 43.6 ms | 1388.2 ms | 16.0 ms   |\n| 60-layer non-shared | 68.6 ms | 3347.7 ms | 29.0 ms   |\n\na teacher. Unfortunately, KD increases training time (slowdown of 2 . 6 -3 . 2 × ) and exhibits comparable or inferior accuracy to label-based training (details in appendix).\n\n## 3.6. On-device Profiling\n\nWe measure the latency for MobileLLM -125M and MobileLLM-LS -125M FP16 models via ExecuTorch 8 on iPhone 13 (iOS 17.2.1), with Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend 9 . Model loading, initialization, and execution time are reported in Table 7. Specifically, execution time is averaged over 50 iterations.\n\nResults in Table 7 reflects that through weight sharing and doubling the number of layers, MobileLLM-LS incurs only a 2.2% increase in loading and initialization time compared to MobileLLM , attributable to their similar model sizes. Execution time also experiences a mere 2.6% overhead, benefitting from data locality. In contrast, a model with a doubled number of layers without weight sharing exhibits a substantial 143% rise in loading and initialization time and an 86% increase in execution time.\n\n## 4. Related Work\n\nThe excellent performance of LLMs has fostered its wide applications. Considering the computational cost and energy\n\n8 https://pytorch.org/executorch-overview\n\n9 https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/build-run-mps.html\n\nconsumption of LLMs, a new stream of research direction have emerged to downsize LLMs to enable on-device inference. These methods include:\n\nModel Compression. Numerous model compression methods are developed for LLMs, including pruning(Xia et al., 2023b), sparsity (Sun et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2023a; Frantar &amp; Alistarh, 2023), and quantization (Liu et al., 2023a; Dettmers et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023; Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023c;b; Frantar et al., 2022). Our research is complementary to these techniques. As also substantiated in Section 3.4, our methodology is compatible with quantization.\n\nSmall Model Design. A limited number of studies have explored compact model architectures, such as TinyLLaMA (Timiryasov &amp; Tastet, 2023). However, even the smallest TinyLLaMA exceeds 1 billion parameters, making them still prohibitive for many on-device applications. Some research proposes large model architectures alongside their smaller LLM variants in a model family (Zhang et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Dey et al., 2023) or an analytical suite containing small LLM variants (Biderman et al., 2023). However, these models are not optimized under the constraint of sub-billion parameters and therefore may not be optimal.\n\nNeural Architecture Search. NAS has garnered substantial attention in the realm of convolutional neural networks, particularly in the context of vision tasks (Tan &amp; Le, 2019; Zoph &amp; Le, 2016; Wu et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020). In contrast, within the transformer domain, the prevailing consensus posits that the model architecture exerts minimal influence on accuracy, provided the total number of parameters remains consistent (Kaplan et al., 2020). Only a limited number of studies have developed NAS algorithms for language transformers, targeting at BERT models (Xu et al., 2021; Jawahar et al., 2023; Ganesan et al., 2021). Our current investigation, focusing on the interplay between depth and width, can be conceptualized as a meticulous grid search within the depth space. The outcomes of that study challenge the prevalent orthodoxy surrounding scaling laws, proposing that deep and thin architectures demonstrate higher performance for compact LLMs.\n\nWeight Sharing. Weight sharing is an intuitive strategy for optimizing model weight utilization within fixed parameter constraints. While the OPT family (Zhang et al., 2022) and subsequent works (Black et al., 2022) leverage weight sharing between input and output embeddings, limited research has explored weight sharing for intermediate layers in transformers (Shen et al., 2022; Reid et al., 2021). Prior efforts often entail specialized designs for shared layers. In contrast, our contribution highlights a more straightforward yet effective way of simply repeating transformer blocks, yielding improved accuracy with a fixed model size and\n\nminimal latency increase.\n\nEfficient Attention and Implementation. In the realm of efficient transformer design, much research has focused on optimizing attention computation through methods like lowrank approximation (Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021) and sparse attention (Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021). Another line of work explores hardware scheduling and weight movement, exemplified by works such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FlexGen (Sheng et al., 2023). In contrast, our primary goal is to optimize model size without introducing new attention computation or efficient hardware implementation methods.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nThis study focuses on optimizing sub-billion scale models for on-device applications. Our findings indicate that, for smaller models, prioritizing depth over width enhances model performance. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced weight-sharing techniques, including embedding sharing, grouped query attention, and block-wise weight sharing, we achieve significant enhancements in weight utilization within storage-constrained scenarios. The resulting models denoted as MobileLLM exhibit substantial advancements in zero-shot commonsense reasoning, question answering, and reading comprehension tasks compared to previous SoTA methods. Last but not least, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the fine-tuned MobileLLM models in two prevalent on-device use cases: chat and API calling, underscoring their adeptness in handling such tasks.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nWe thank Hansong Zhang for his valuable contribution to setting up the latency measurement environment on iOS, and the full support from the PyTorch edge team.\n\n## Impact Statement\n\nThis paper advocates for the adoption of sub-billion scale large language models in on-device applications, aiming to mitigate energy consumption during LLM inference. The proposed approach is promising in alleviating computational costs associated with LLM deployment.\n\n## References\n\n- Ainslie, J., Lee-Thorp, J., de Jong, M., Zemlyanskiy, Y., Lebron, F., and Sanghai, S.

Scaling Up to Larger Model Architectures\n\nIn this paper, we primarily investigated two model sizes, MobileLLM -125M and MobileLLM -350M. In this section, we extended our design principles-SwiGLU, deeper architecture, grouped-query attention, and embedding sharing-to larger models, pre-training MobileLLM -600M, 1B, and 1.5B variants. This expansion facilitates a broader range of applications across different memory constraints. Table 8 compares MobileLLM with various general-purpose 10 pre-trained models, including i.e. OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), GPT-neo (Black et al., 2022), Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), TinyLlama (Zhang et al., 2024), Cerebras-GPT (Dey et al., 2023), Galactica (Taylor et al., 2022), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), LaMini-GPT (Wu et al., 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023) as well as a recent model MobiLlama (Thawakar et al., 2024) released after MobileLLM .\n\nThe results in Table 8 demonstrate that MobileLLM consistently surpasses previous models of similar scale. Notably, MobileLLM -1.5B achieves an average accuracy of 59.4 points on zero-shot commonsense reasoning tasks, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model, Qwen1.5-1.8B, by 2.9 points despite the latter having more parameters.

Impact of Each Design Choice\n\nThis section presents comprehensive tabulated results for the improving sub-billion scale LLM design experiments, at the model sizes of 125M and 350M. Looking at the results in Table 10, transitioning from the traditional Feedforward Network ( FC → ReLU → FC ) to SwiGLU yields an accuracy improvement of 1.3% for both model sizes. Further increasing the model depth enhances accuracy by 0.9%/1.1% for 125M/350M models, respectively. Then, introducing input and output embedding sharing achieves a parameter reduction of approximately 10%, while with only marginal accuracy drops of 0.2% for 125M and 0.6% for 350M models. Additionally, following in findings in Section D, we incorporate grouped query attention with a head dimension equal to 64, and a head number to near 4 × to the kv-head number, while increasing the embedding dimension to preserve model size. This modification further results in a performance boost of 0.4%/0.7% for 125M/350M models. Combining these techniques establishes a strong baseline network denoted as MobileLLM . Finally, the immediate block-wise weight-sharing technique contributes an additional accuracy gain of 1.1% for models trained on 0.25 trillion tokens, resulting in the model MobileLLM-LS . Final models including MobileLLM and MobileLLM-LS are trained with 1 trillion tokens.\n\nTable 10: Ablation study on the impact of each design choice on the model accuracy on zero-shot common sense reasoning tasks.

Depth vs Width\n\nWe provide network depth versus width exploration results on zero-shot reasoning tasks in Table 11, as well as results on question answering and reading comprehension tasks in Table 12. The findings indicate that shallow architectures with fewer than 10 layers perform poorly in reasoning or handling comprehension tasks. Models with 10-20 layers exhibit improved accuracy, while further increasing depth continues to provide significant benefits across all three tasks. Notably, the optimal depth is found to be near 30 layers for sub-billion scale models.\n\n## D. Number of Heads and Key-Value Heads\n\nWe provide detailed experimental results assessing the impact of the number of attention heads and key-value heads on zero-shot reasoning accuracy in Table 13. Our study involves two baseline architectures: an 8-layer 125M model with an embedding dimension of 896, and a 15-layer 350M model with an embedding dimension of 1280. We conduct head size sweeps in {8, 16, 32}. The findings shown in Table 13 indicate that using 16 heads, with a head dimension close to 64, and 4 key-value heads, yields the best accuracy and memory trade-off. This setting serves as a guiding principle in our model architecture design.\n\n## E. Layer-Sharing Number Ablation\n\nWe extended our investigation to determine the optimal number of layer repetitions. The experiment involved the 8-layer 125M model with an embedding dimension of 896 and the 15-layer 350M model with an embedding dimension of 1280.\n\nTable 11: Ablation study on depth versus width in architecture design, illustrated in Figure 4 (a)(b). For compact models, prioritizing depth over width yields superior performance, assessed through zero-shot common sense reasoning tasks.\n\n|   #Layer |   #Heads |   Dim |   #Params(M) |   ARC-e |

0.4-0.6%. However, as we further triple or quadruple the layer repetition times, this accuracy enhancement effect diminishes. Consequently, in our experiments, we adopt a configuration where every two blocks share weights, effectively doubling the total number of layers.\n\n## F. Compatibility with Quantization\n\nThis section explores the compatibility of quantization with the proposed model architecture and layer sharing. We employ a straightforward per-token min-max quantization, quantizing both weight and activation to 8-bit using post-training quantization (PTQ). Experiments are conducted on both MobileLLM and MobileLLM-LS with model sizes of 125M and 350M, trained on 0.25T tokens. Results in Table 15 demonstrate that W8A8 PTQ results in a modest accuracy drop of within 0.5% and is compatible with the proposed layer-sharing method.\n\n## G. Knowledge Distillation\n\nThe results of integrating knowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015) into small model pre-training are presented in Table 16. LLaMA-v2 7B models serve as the teacher, and the KD loss is computed using cross-entropy between the logits\n\nTable 13: Ablation study investigating the impact of the number of attention heads and

case, equals the size of the vocabulary. T and S are the teacher and student networks, respectively.\n\nThe results in Table 16 indicate that adding KD loss is comparable to or even lower than solely using the next token as labels. However, it's noteworthy that the training time using KD is 2 . 6 -3 . 2 × slower than training from scratch using labels. All models are trained on 32 A100 80G GPUs with a batch size of 32 for 120k iterations. Consequently, we opt to use labels in our experiments.\n\n## H. Datasets and Benchmarks\n\nMobileLLM is assessed on zero-shot common sense reasoning (BoolQ, PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, Winogrande, ARC, OBQA), question answering (TriviaQA), and reading comprehension (RACE) tasks. Additionally, we evaluate our chat models on MT-Bench and AlpacaEval benchmarks. We also generated an API calling dataset to fine-tune and evaluate models for this particular task.\n\nTable 15: Ablation study: 8-bit weight, 8-bit activation post-training quantization results on zero-shot common sense reasoning tasks.

Zero-shot Common Sense Reasoning tasks\n\nBoolQ (Clark et al., 2019) is a reading comprehension dataset focused on naturally occurring yes/no questions. Each instance includes a question (Q), an excerpt from a passage (P), and an answer (A), with an added explanation for enhanced clarity.\n\nPIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), abbreviated for Physical Interaction: Question Answering, serves as a benchmark for evaluating and studying the capacity of natural language models in comprehending physical commonsense understanding.\n\nSIQA (Sap et al., 2019), abbreviated for Social Interaction Question Answering, is designed to measure the social and emotional intelligence of computational models through multiple-choice question answering.\n\nHellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019) serves as a benchmark for physically situated commonsense natural language inference. It comprises four-way multiple-choice problems that are considered trivial for humans (&gt;95% accuracy) but pose a challenge for language models.\n\nWinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021) is a benchmark for commonsense reasoning. It consists of a set of 273 expert-crafted pronoun resolution problems, deliberately designed to be unsolvable for statistical models relying on selectional preferences or word associations.\n\nARC (Clark et al., 2018), the AI2 Reasoning Challenge, is a compilation of 7787 natural science questions. It is divided into a Challenge Set and an Easy Set, with the Challenge Set exclusively comprising questions that were answered incorrectly by both a retrieval-based algorithm and a word co-occurrence algorithm.\n\nOBQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018) is a dataset consisting of approximately 6000 questions designed for open-book question answering. The task involves integrating a corpus of provided science facts (open book) with external broad common knowledge. Providing correct answers necessitates leveraging simple common knowledge beyond the core facts provided.\n\n## H.2. Question Answering Tasks\n\nTriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) is a closed-book question answering benchmark. It encompasses over 650,000 question-answer evidence triples derived by combining 95,000 question-answer pairs authored by Trivia enthusiasts. Each question is supported by an average of six evidence documents.\n\n## H.3. Reading Comprehension Tasks\n\nRACE (Lai et al., 2017) is a large-scale reading comprehension dataset with more than 28,000 passages and nearly 100,000 questions. The dataset is collected from English examinations in China, which are designed for middle school and high school students.\n\n## H.4. Chat Benchmarks\n\nAlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023) is a single-turn benchmark featuring 805 questions across various topics. In the evaluation of this paper, models generate responses and are scored by GPT-4, with the ultimate metric being the pairwise win rate against a baseline model (text-davinci-001).\n\nMT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) is a multi-turn benchmark comprising 160 questions spanning eight diverse knowledge domains. In this evaluation, models are tasked with answering an initial question and subsequently providing a second response to a predefined follow-up question. Each model response is rated by GPT-4 on a scale from 1 to 10, and the final score is determined by the mean over the two turns.\n\n## H.5. API Calling Dataset\n\nThe API calling dataset is generated by instructing a language model to simulate a conversation between a human and an agent. This process instructs the language model to explicitly mention tasks that should be performed using designated APIs throughout the simulated conversation. Examples of a conversation turn in the generated dataset are shown in the following boxes.\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"USER\", \"message\": \"Can you help me send a SMS message: We are looking forward to seeing you\"}, {\"role\": \"PARSER\", \"message\": \"style_transfer(text = \"We are looking forward to seeing you\", style = [\"sms\"], contact = None)\"}, {\"role\": \"AGENT\", \"message\": \"Sure!

While this news does not necessarily prove the existence of aliens, it does provide hope for the possibility of finding life beyond Earth. Additionally, a recent study published in the journal Nature has suggested that the universe may be teeming with alien civilizations, with estimates suggesting that there could be tens of billions of intelligent civilizations in the observable universe. However, it's important to note that these findings are still being researched and debated in the scientific community.\"},\n\n{\"role\": \"PARSER\", \"message\": \"news(query = \"latest alien news\")\"},\n\n{\"role\": \"USER\", \"message\": \"Who won the last Super Bowl?\"},\n\n{\"role\": \"PARSER\", \"message\": \"get\\_sports\\_information(match = \"\", sport\\_type = \"NFL\", metric = \"winner\")\"},\n\n{\"role\": \"AGENT\", \"message\": \"The last Super Bowl was won by the Kansas City Chiefs.\"},\n\n## I. Approximate calculation of envisioned future GPU consumption\n\n#GPUs = 7 . 88 × 10 9 (population size) × 5% (individual time 11 ) × 220 × 10 9 (approximating FLOPs/token for 220B GPT-4 model with one expert activated 12 ) × 50 (token/s) × 24 (h) × 3600 (s) / ( 60 × 10 12 (FLOPs/s, H100 computation capacity ) × 24 (h) × 3600 (s)) ≈ 1 × 10 8\n\nThis assumes short sequence lengths ( i.e. hundreds of tokens, not tens of thousands of tokens), where the compute is dominated by linear layers. For very long sequences, the self-attention computation would dominate, and this would necessitate a more complicated formula.\n\n## J.
