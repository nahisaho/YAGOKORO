The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training.

In a bit more detail, we first compute the feature embedding of the image and the feature embedding of the set of possible texts by their respective encoders. The cosine similarity of these embeddings is then calculated, scaled by a temperature parameter τ , and normalized into a probability distribution via a softmax.

In Figure 5 we show this comparison across 27 datasets.

This is likely due to an important difference between the zero-shot and few-shot approach. First, CLIP's zero-shot classifier is generated via natural language which allows for visual concepts to be directly specified ('communicated'). By contrast, 'normal' supervised learning must infer concepts indirectly from training examples. Context-less example-based learning has the drawback that many different hypotheses can be consistent with the data, especially in the one-shot case. A single image often contains many different visual concepts.

On all 5 datasets, both zero-shot accuracy and fully supervised accuracy are over 90%. This suggests that CLIP may be more effective at zero-shot transfer for tasks where its underlying representations are also high quality. The slope of a linear regression model predicting zero-shot performance as a function of fully supervised performance estimates that for every 1% improvement in fully supervised performance, zero-shot performance improves by 1.28%. However, the 95th-percentile confidence intervals still include values of less than 1 (0.93-1.79).\n\nOver the past few years, empirical studies of deep learning systems have documented that performance is predictable as a function of important quantities such as training compute and dataset size (Hestness et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2020).",

There exist many ways to evaluate the quality of representations as well as disagreements over what properties an 'ideal' representation should have (Locatello et al., 2020). Fitting a linear classifier on a representation extracted from the model and measuring its performance on various datasets is a common approach. An alternative is measuring the performance of end-to-end fine-tuning of the model. This increases flexibility, and prior work has convincingly demonstrated that fine-tuning outperforms linear classification on most image classification datasets (Kornblith et al., 2019; Zhai et al., 2019). While the high performance of fine-tuning motivates its study for practical reasons, we still opt for linear classifier based evaluation for several reasons.",

Our work is focused on developing a high-performing task and dataset-agnostic pre-training approach. Fine-tuning, because it adapts representations to each dataset during the fine-tuning phase, can compensate for and potentially mask failures to learn general and robust representations during the pre-training phase. Linear classifiers, because of their limited flexibility, instead highlight these failures and provide clear feedback during development.

(2020) to, if possible, study these questions on their models as well.\n\nWe also investigate another robustness intervention enabled by flexible zero-shot natural-language-based image classifiers.

Two datasets, Youtube-BB and ImageNet-Vid, consist of superclasses of ImageNet. This presents a problem when trying to use the fixed 1000-way classifier of an ImageNet model to make predictions. Taori et al. (2020) handle this by max- pooling predictions across all sub-classes according to the ImageNet class hierarchy. Sometimes this mapping is much less than perfect. For the person class in Youtube-BB, predictions are made by pooling over the ImageNet classes for a baseball player, a bridegroom, and a scuba diver. With CLIP we can instead generate a custom zero-shot classifier for each dataset directly based on its class names. In Figure 14 we see that this improves average effective robustness by 5% but is concentrated in large improvements on only a few datasets. Curiously, accuracy on ObjectNet also increases by 2.3%.",

To better understand this difference, we investigate how effective robustness changes on the continuum from zero-shot to fully supervised.

This is important to investigate since, in a worst-case scenario, a complete copy of an evaluation dataset could leak into the pre-training dataset and invalidate the evaluation as a meaningful test of generalization. One option to prevent this is to identify and remove all duplicates before training a model. While this guarantees reporting true hold-out performance, it requires knowing all possible data which a model might be evaluated on ahead of time. This has the downside of limiting the scope of benchmarking and analysis. Adding a new evaluation would require an expensive re-train or risk reporting an un-quantified benefit due to overlap.\n\nInstead, we document how much overlap occurs and how performance changes due to these overlaps.

An embarrassingly simple baseline of logistic regression on raw pixels outperforms zero-shot CLIP. Both semantic and near-duplicate nearest-neighbor retrieval verify that there are almost no images that resemble MNIST digits in our pre-training dataset. This suggests CLIP does little to address the underlying problem of brittle generalization of deep learning models. Instead CLIP tries to circumvent the problem and hopes that by training on such a large and varied dataset that all data will be effectively in-distribution. This is a naive assumption that, as MNIST demonstrates, is easy to violate.\n\nAlthough CLIP can flexibly generate zero-shot classifiers for a wide variety of tasks and datasets, CLIP is still limited to choosing from only those concepts in a given zero-shot classifier.",

This is a significant restriction compared to a truly flexible approach like image captioning which could generate novel outputs. Unfortunately, as described in Section 2.3 we found the computational efficiency of the image caption baseline we tried to be much lower than CLIP. A simple idea worth trying is joint training of a contrastive and generative objective with the hope of combining the efficiency of CLIP with the flexibility of a caption model.

These validation sets often have thousands of examples, which is unrealistic for true zero-shot scenarios. Similar concerns have been raised in the field of semi-supervised learning (Oliver et al., 2018). Another potential issue is our selection of evaluation datasets.

Many complex tasks and visual concepts can be difficult to specify just through text. Actual training examples are undeniably useful but CLIP does not optimize for few-shot performance directly. In our work, we fall back to fitting linear classifiers on top of CLIP's features. This results in a counter-intuitive drop in performance when transitioning from a zero-shot to a few-shot setting.

Like any image classification system, CLIP's performance and fitness for purpose need to be evaluated, and its broader impacts analyzed in context.

This capability introduces challenges similar to those found in characterizing other, large-scale generative models like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020); models that exhibit non-trivial zero-shot (or fewshot) generalization can have a vast range of capabilities, many of which are made clear only after testin",

(2020) extended this line of work to an additional modality by adding raw audio as an additional supervision source and demonstrated benefits from combining all three sources of supervision.\n\nAs part of our work on CLIP we also construct a new dataset of image-text pairs. Modern work on image-text retrieval has relied on a set of crowd-sourced sentence level image caption evaluation datasets like Pascal1K (Rashtchian et al., 2010), Flickr8K (Hodosh et al., 2013), and Flickr30K (Young et al., 2014). However, these datasets are still relatively small and limit achievable performance. Several methods have been proposed to create larger datasets automatically with Ordonez et al. (2011) as a notable early example. In the deep learning era, Mithun et al. (2018) demonstrated an additional set of (image, text) pairs collected from the internet could improve retrieval performance and several new automatically constructed datasets such as Conceptual Captions (Sharma et al., 2018), LAIT",

This line of work queries image search engines to build image datasets by querying for terms and uses the queries as the labels for the returned images (Fergus et al., 2005). Classifiers trained on these large but noisily labeled datasets can be competitive with those trained on smaller carefully labeled datasets.",

These image-query pairs are also often used to improve performance on standard datasets as additional training data (Chen &amp; Gupta, 2015). CLIP also uses search queries as part of its dataset creation process. However CLIP only uses full text sequences co-occuring with images as supervision rather than just the queries, which are often only a single word or short n-gram. We also restrict this step in CLIP to text only querying for sub-string matches while most webly supervised work uses standard image search engines which have their own complex retrieval and filtering pipelines that often involve computer vision systems.",

CLIP is instead focused on learning visual models from scratch via natural language supervision and does not densely connect the two domains with a joint attention model.

In order to optimize their training objective, CLIP models learn to perform a wide variety of tasks during pretraining.

For CLIP-ViT models, we used the features before the linear projection to the embedding space, which corresponds to I f in Figure 3. We train a logistic regression classifier using scikit-learn's L-BFGS implementation, with maximum 1,000 iterations, and report the corresponding metric for each dataset. We determine the L2 regularization strength λ using a hyperparameter sweep on the validation sets over the range between 10 -6 and 10 6 , with 96 logarithmically spaced steps. To save compute required for the sweeps, we perform a parametric binary search that starts with λ = [10 -6 , 10 -4 , 10 -2 , 1 , 10 2 , 10 4 , 10 6 ] and iteratively halves the interval around the peak until it reaches a resolution of 8 steps per decade.

While it is intuitive to use a model's own notion of similarity, we encountered issues. We found the model's feature space is weighted very heavily towards semantic similarity. Many false positives occurred due to distinct objects that would be described similarly (soccer balls, flowers of the same species, etc...) having almost perfect similarity. We also observed the model was quite poor at assigning certain kinds of near-duplicates high similarity scores. We noticed repeatedly that images with high-frequency textures (such as fur or stripe patterns) pre-processed by different resizing algorithms (nearest neighbor vs bi-linear) could have surprisingly low similarity. This resulted in many false negatives.",

We created a synthetic data augmentation pipeline that combined a variety of common image manipulations. The augmentation pipeline combines random cropping and zooming, aspect ratio distortion, downsizing and upscaling to different resolutions, minor rotations, jpeg compression, and HSV color jitter. The pipeline also randomly selects from different interpolation algorithms for all relevant steps. We then trained a model to maximize the similarity of an image and its transformed variant while minimizing similarity to all other images in a training batch. We used the same n-pair / InfoNCE loss as CLIP but with a fixed temperature of 0.07.",

We modified the base ResNet-50 with the anti-alias improvements from (Zhang, 2019) and used weight norm (Salimans &amp; Kingma, 2016) instead of batch norm (Ioffe &amp; Szegedy, 2015) to avoid leaking information about duplicates via batch statistics - a problem previously noted in (Henaff, 2020). We also found the GELU activation function (Hendrycks &amp; Gimpel, 2016) to perform better for this task. We trained the model with a total batch size of 1,712 for approximately 30 million images sampled from our pretraining dataset. At the end of training it achieves nearly 100% accuracy on its proxy training task.",

We train each model for 32 epochs at which point transfer performance begins to plateau due to overfitting. Results are shown in Table 12. Across our whole eval suite, YFCC and WIT perform similarly on average for both zero-shot and linear probe settings. However, performance on specific fine-grained classification datasets can vary widely - sometimes by over 10%. Our speculation is that these differences in performance reflect the relative density of relevant data in each pre-training dataset. For instance, pre-training on YFCC100M, which might contain many photos of birds and flowers (common subjects for photographers), results in better performance on Birdsnap and Flowers102, while pre-training on WIT results in better car",

This mirrors recent work which reported positive results using the same contrastive pre-training objective on the relatively different domain of medical imaging (Zhang et al., 2020). It also is similar to the findings of noisy student self-training which reported only slight improvements when using their JFT300M dataset over YFCC100M (Xie et al., 2020).

To compensate, models are augmented with the outputs of custom OCR engines and features to boost performance on tasks where this capability is required (Singh et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). Early during the development of CLIP, we noticed that CLIP began to learn primitive OCR capabilities which appeared to steadily improve over the course of the project. To evaluate this qualitatively noticed behavior, we measured performance on 5 datasets requiring the direct and indirect use of OCR. Three of these datasets MNIST (LeCun), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), and IIIT5K (Mishra et al., 2012) directly check the ability of a model to perform low-level character and word recognition, while Hateful Memes (Kiela et al., 2020) and SST",

Fully supervised CLIP is also surprisingly strong on Hateful Meme detection, where CLIP is only 0.7 points behind the current single model SOTA and several points above the best baseline from the original paper. Similar to SST-2, these other results on Hateful Memes use the ground truth text which CLIP does not have access to.",

Similar to SST-2, these other results on Hateful Memes use the ground truth text which CLIP does not have access to. Finally, we note that zero-shot CLIP outperforms the best results using fully supervised linear probes across all other 56 models included in our evaluation suite. This suggests CLIP's OCR capability is at least somewhat unique compared to existing work on self-supervised and supervised representation learning.\n\nTable 13. CLIP improves zero-shot retrieval and is competitive with the best fine-tuned result on Flickr30k text retrieval. Bold indicates best overall performance while an underline indicates best in category performance (zero-shot or fine-tuned). For all other models, best results from the paper are reported regardless of model size / variant. MSCOCO performance is reported on the 5k test set.",

A CLIP model, since it is trained to pair semi-arbitrary text with images, is likely to receive supervision for a wide range of visual concepts involving both common and proper nouns, verbs, and adjectives. ImageNet-1K, by contrast, only labels common nouns. Does the lack of broader supervision in ImageNet result in weaker transfer of ImageNet models to tasks involving the recognition of visual concepts that are not nouns?\n\nTo investigate this, we measure and compare the performance of CLIP and ImageNet models on several video\n\nTable 15.

However it is a new benchmark so to compare with prior work on geolocalization we also report results on the IM2GPS test set from Hays &amp; Efros (2008) in Table 17. Since IM2GPS is a regression benchmark, we guess the GPS coordinates of the nearest image in a set of reference images using CLIP's embedding space. This is not a zeroshot result since it uses nearest-neighbor regression. Despite querying only 1 million images, which is much less than prior work, CLIP performs similarly to several task specific models.

Performance results per dataset are provided in Table 16 and compared with the current state of the art results reported in Taori et al. (2020)'s evaluation suite. Zero-shot CLIP improves the state of the art on 5 of the 7 datasets, ImageNet-R, ObjectNet, ImageNet-Sketch, ImageNet-Vid, and YoutubeBB. CLIP's improvements are largest on ImageNet-Vid and Youtube-BB due to its flexible zero-shot capability and on ImageNet-R, which likely reflects CLIP's pre-training distribution including significant amounts of creative content. A similar behavior has been documented for the Instagram pre-trained ResNeXt models as discussed in Taori et al. (2020).",
