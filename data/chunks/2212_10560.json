Nevertheless, they depend heavily on human-written instruction data that is often limited in quantity, diversity, and creativity, therefore hindering the generality of the tuned model. We introduce Self-Instruct, a framework for improving the instruction-following capabilities of pretrained language models by bootstrapping off their own generations. Our pipeline generates instructions, input, and output samples from a language model, then filters invalid or similar ones before using them to finetune the original model. Applying our method to the vanilla GPT3, we demonstrate a 33% absolute improvement over the original model on Super-NaturalInstructions, on par with the performance of InstructGPT-001, which was trained with private user data and human annotations. For further evaluation, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks, and show through human evaluation that tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute gap behind InstructGPT-001. Self-Instruct provides an almost annotation-free method for aligning pre-trained language models with instructions, and we release our large synthetic dataset to facilitate future studies on instruction tuning.

The overall process is an iterative bootstrapping algorithm (see Figure 2), which starts off with a limited (e.g., 175 in our study) seed set of manually-written tasks that are used to guide the overall generation. In the first phase, the model is prompted to generate instructions for new tasks. This step leverages the existing collection of instructions to create more broad-coverage instructions that define (often new) tasks. Given the newlygenerated set of instructions, the framework also creates input-output instances for them, which can be later used for supervising the instruction tuning.",

We then use this improved version of our data to finetune GPT3. This can be regarded as a distillation of InstructGPT 003 with our data.

The major differences are that 1) they use tasks in SUPERNI (Wang et al., 2022) as their seed tasks, resulting in a different distribution of generated tasks; 2) they employ InstructGPT 002 for generating the data, in which sense they are distilling knowledge from an already instruction-tuned model, while we solely rely on the vanilla LM; 3) the detailed generation pipeline and templates are different.",

This allows either finetuning the model with extra unlabeled training data, or direct application at inference time. While SELF-INSTRUCT has similarities with the self-training literature, most self-training methods assume a specific target task as well as unlabeled examples under it; in contrast, SELF-INSTRUCT produces a variety of tasks from scratch.\n\nKnowledge distillation.

We further categorized the tasks into classification and non-classification tasks, based on whether the task has a limited output label space. In total, there are 25 classification tasks and 150 non-classification tasks. We release this data in our GitHub repository. 11\n\nOur method relies on a set of seed tasks to bootstrap the generation. The seed tasks are important for both encouraging the task diversity and demonstrating correct ways for solving the diverse tasks. For example, with coding tasks to prompt the model, it has a larger chance to generate coding-related tasks; it's also better to have coding output to guide the model in writing code for new tasks.",

So, the more diverse the seed tasks are, the more diverse and better quality the generated tasks will be.\n\nTo provide a sense of how much the model is generalizing beyond these seed tasks, we further quantify the overlap between the instructions of these seed tasks and the instructions of our test sets, including both SUPERNI task instructions (§4.3) and the user-oriented instructions in our human evaluation(§4.4). We compute ROUGE-L similarities between each seed instruction and its most similar instruction in the test set. The distribution of the ROUGE-L scores are plotted in Figure 8, with the average ROUGE-L similarity between the seed instructions and SUPERNI as 0.21, and the average ROUGE-L similarity between the seed instructions and user-oriented instructions as 0.34.",

The scientists traveled for a long time before they found a planet that looked like a good place to live. They sent a message back to the people telling them about the planet. The people were excited and started preparing for the journey. They built spaceships and flew to the new planet. When they arrived, they saw that the planet was beautiful. There were trees and rivers and mountains. The people were so happy that they finally found a new home. They started building houses and planting crops.",

They are very intelligent and have created many things that help them in their daily lives. One day, they decided to create a machine that can make food for them. The machine was able to produce food but it also produced something else. It produced a liquid that could be used as fuel for the machines. The people were happy because they didn't need to go out and look for food or fuel anymore. They had everything they needed right there in their homes. However, one day, the machine stopped working. The people tried to fix it but couldn't figure out what went wrong. They tried to find someone who could help them but no one knew how to fix the machine. After a few days, the people realized that they would die if they didn't do anything about it. So, they decided to send some of their best scientists to space to find a new planet where they could live. The scientists traveled for a long time before they found a planet that looked like a good place to live. They sent a message back to the people telling them about the planet. The people were excited and started preparing for the journey. They built spaceships and flew to the new planet. When they arrived, they saw that the planet was beautiful. There were trees and rivers and mountains. The people were so happy that they finally found a new home. They started building houses and planting crops. They lived happily ever after. | Instruction: ✓ Input: ✗ Output: ✓ |\n| Instruction: Find out what the author's attitude towards working part-time is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Paragraph: Working part-time is a great way to earn some extra money while still being able to enjoy your free time.

Once the transaction is confirmed by the network, the buyer has no way to get his money back, so he will be forced to go through with the purchase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Instruction: ✓ Input: ✓ Output: ✗ |"
