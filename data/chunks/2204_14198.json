    "abstract": "Building models that can be rapidly adapted to novel tasks using only a handful of annotated examples is an open challenge for multimodal machine learning research. We introduce Flamingo, a family of Visual Language Models (VLM) with this ability. We propose key architectural innovations to: (i) bridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models, (ii) handle sequences of arbitrarily interleaved visual and textual data, and (iii) seamlessly ingest images or videos as inputs. Thanks to their flexibility, Flamingo models can be trained on large-scale multimodal web corpora containing arbitrarily interleaved text and images, which is key to endow them with in-context few-shot learning capabilities. We perform a thorough evaluation of our models, exploring and measuring their ability to rapidly adapt to a variety of image and video tasks. These include open-ended tasks such as visual question-answering, where the model is prompted with a question which it has to answer; captioning tasks, which evaluate the ability to describe a scene or an event; and close-ended tasks such as multiple-choice visual question-answering. For tasks lying anywhere on this spectrum, a single Flamingo model can achieve a new state of the art with few-shot learning, simply by prompting the model with task-specific examples. On numerous benchmarks, Flamingo outperforms models fine-tuned on thousands of times more task-specific data.",

      "content": "One key aspect of intelligence is the ability to quickly learn to perform a new task given a short instruction [33, 70]. While initial progress has been made towards a similar capability in computer vision, the most widely used paradigm still consists of first pretraining on a large amount of supervised data, before fine-tuning the model on the task of interest [66, 118, 143]. However, successful finetuning often requires many thousands of annotated data points. In addition, it often requires careful per-task hyperparameter tuning and is also resource intensive. Recently, multimodal vision-language models trained with a contrastive objective [50, 85] have enabled zero-shot adaptation to novel tasks, without the need for fine-tuning. However, because these models simply provide a similarity score between a text and an image, they can only address limited use cases such as classification, where a finite set of outcomes is provided beforehand.",

Others have explored visually-conditioned language generation [17, 114, 119, 124, 132] but have not yet shown good performance in low-data regimes.\n\nWe introduce Flamingo , a Visual Language Model (VLM) that sets a new state of the art in few-shot learning on a wide range of open-ended vision and language tasks, simply by being prompted with a few input/output examples, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Of the 16 tasks we consider, Flamingo also surpasses the fine-tuned state of the art on 6 tasks, despite using orders of magnitude less task-specific training data (see Figure 2). To achieve this, Flamingo takes inspiration from recent work on large language models (LMs) which are good few-shot learners [11, 18, 42, 86]. A single large LM can achieve strong performance on many tasks using only its text interface: a few examples of a task are provided to the model as a prompt, along with a query input, and the model generates a continuation to produce a predicted output for that query. We show that the same can be done for image and video understanding tasks such as classification, captioning, or question-answering: these can be cast as text prediction problems with visual input conditioning. The difference from a LM is that the model must be able to ingest a multimodal prompt containing images and/or videos interleaved with text.",

For video inputs, frames are sampled at 1 FPS and encoded independently to obtain a 3D spatio-temporal grid of features to which learned temporal embeddings are added. Features are then flattened to 1D before being fed to the Perceiver Resampler. More details on the contrastive model training and performance are given in Appendix B.1.3 and Appendix B.3.2, respectively.\n\nPerceiver Resampler: from varying-size large feature maps to few visual tokens.

This module connects the vision encoder to the frozen language model as shown in Figure 3. It takes as input a variable number of image or video features from the vision encoder and produces a fixed number of visual outputs (64), reducing the computational complexity of the vision-text cross-attention. Similar to Perceiver [48] and DETR [13], we learn a predefined number of latent input queries which are fed to a Transformer and cross-attend to the visual features. We show in our ablation studies (Section 3.3) that using such a vision-language resampler module outperforms a plain Transformer and an MLP. We provide an illustration, more architectural details, and pseudo-code in Appendix A.1.1.",

At a given text token, the model attends to the visual tokens of the image that appeared just before it in the interleaved sequence, rather than to all previous images (formalized and illustrated in Appendix A.1.3). Though the model only directly attends to a single image at a time, the dependency on all previous images remains via self-attention in the LM. This single-image cross-attention scheme importantly allows the model to seamlessly generalise to any number of visual inputs, regardless of how many are used during training. In particular, we use only up to 5 images per sequence when training on our interleaved datasets, yet our model is able to benefit from sequences of up to 32 pairs (or 'shots') of images/videos and corresponding texts during evaluation.",

A single Flamingo model reaches the state of the art on a wide array of image (I) and video (V) understanding tasks with few-shot learning, significantly outperforming previous best zero- and few-shot methods with as few as four examples. More importantly, using only 32 examples and without adapting any model weights, Flamingo outperforms the current best methods - fine-tuned on thousands of annotated examples - on seven tasks.",

      "content": "Our goal is to develop models that can rapidly adapt to diverse and challenging tasks. For this, we consider a wide array of 16 popular multimodal image/video and language benchmarks. In order to validate model design decisions during the course of the project, 5 of these benchmarks were used as part of our development (DEV) set: COCO, OKVQA, VQAv2, MSVDQA and VATEX. Performance estimates on the DEV benchmarks may be biased, as a result of model selection. We note that this is also the case for prior work which makes use of similar benchmarks to validate and ablate design decisions. To account for this, we report performance on an additional set of 11 benchmarks, spanning captioning, video question-answering, as well as some less commonly explored capabilities such as visual dialogue and multi-choice question-answering tasks. The evaluation benchmarks are described in Appendix B.1.4. We keep all evaluation hyperparameters fixed across all benchmarks.",

We keep all evaluation hyperparameters fixed across all benchmarks. Depending on the task, we use four few-shot prompt templates we describe in more detail in Appendix B.1.5. We emphasize that we do not validate any design decisions on these 11 benchmarks and use them solely to estimate unbiased few-shot learning performance of our models.\n\nConcretely, estimating few-shot learning performance of a model involves prompting it with a set of support samples and evaluating it on a set of query samples. For the DEV benchmarks that are used both to validate design decisions and hyperparameters, as well as to report final performance, we therefore use four subsets: validation support , validation query , test support and test query . For other benchmarks, we need only the latter two. We report in Appendix B.1.4 how we form these subsets.",

More importantly, Flamingo is often competitive with state-of-the-art methods additionally fine-tuned on up to hundreds of thousands of annotated examples. On six tasks, Flamingo even outperforms the fine-tuned SotA despite using a single set of model weights and only 32 task-specific examples.\n\nTable 2: Comparison to SotA when fine-tuning Flamingo . We fine-tune Flamingo on all nine tasks where Flamingo does not achieve SotA with few-shot learning.

As shown in Figure 2, the larger the model, the better the few-shot performance, similar to GPT-3 [11]. The performance also improves with the number of shots. We further find that the largest model better exploits larger numbers of shots. Interestingly, even though our Flamingo models were trained with sequences limited to only 5 images on M3W , they are still able to benefit from up to 32 images or videos during inference. This demonstrates the flexibility of the Flamingo architecture for processing a variable number of videos or images.",

In short, we do so by fine-tuning the model on a short schedule with a small learning rate by additionally unfreezing the vision backbone to accommodate a higher input resolution (details in Appendix B.2.2). We find that we can improve results over our previously presented in-context few-shot learning results, setting a new state of the art on five additional tasks: VQAv2, V ATEX, VizWiz, MSRVTTQA, and HatefulMemes.",

The paradigm of first pretraining on a vast amount of data followed by an adaptation on a downstream task has become standard [11, 23, 32, 44, 52, 75, 87, 108]. In this work, we build on the 70B Chinchilla language model [42] as the base LM for Flamingo . Numerous works have explored techniques to adapt language models to novel tasks using a few examples. These include adding small adapter modules [43], fine-tuning a small part of the LM [141], showing in-context examples in the prompt [11], or optimizing the prompt [56, 60] through gradient descent. In this paper, we take inspiration from the in-context [11] few-shot learning technique instead of more involved few-shot learning approaches based on metric learning [24, 103, 112, 117] or meta-learning [6, 7, 27, 31, 91, 155].",

These LM breakthroughs have been influential for vision-language modelling. In particular, BERT [23] inspired a large body of vision-language work [16, 28, 29, 38, 59, 61, 66, 101, 106, 107, 109, 118, 121, 142, 143, 151]. We differ from these approaches as Flamingo models do not require fine-tuning on new tasks. Another family of vision-language models is based on contrastive learning [2, 5, 49, 50, 57, 74, 82, 85, 138, 140, 146]. Flamingo differs from contrastive models as it can generate text, although we build and rely upon them for our vision encoder. Similar to our work are VLMs able to generate text in an autoregressive manner [19, 25, 45, 67, 116].",

Manually annotated vision and language datasets are costly to obtain and thus relatively small (10k-100k) in scale [3, 15, 69, 122, 129, 139]. To alleviate this lack of data, numerous works [14, 50, 98, 110] automatically scrape readily available paired vision-text data. In addition to such paired data, we show the importance of also training on entire multimodal webpages containing interleaved images and text as a single sequence. Concurrent work CM3 [1] proposes to generate HTML markup from pages, while we simplify the text prediction task by only generating plain text. We emphasize few-shot learning and vision tasks while CM3 [1] primarily evaluates on language-only benchmarks in a zero-shot or fine-tuned setup.",

For example, LM priors are generally helpful, but may play a role in occasional hallucinations and ungrounded guesses. Furthermore, LMs generalise poorly to sequences longer than the training ones. They also suffer from poor sample efficiency during training. Addressing these issues can accelerate progress in the field and enhance the abilities of VLMs like Flamingo.\n\nSecond, the classification performance of Flamingo lags behind that of state-of-the-art contrastive models [82, 85]. These models directly optimize for text-image retrieval, of which classification is a special case. In contrast, our models handle a wider range of tasks, such as open-ended ones. A unified approach to achieve the best of both worlds is an important research direction.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of in-context learning when access is limited to only a few dozen examples. In-context learning also enables simple deployment, requiring only inference, generally with no hyperparameter tuning needed. However, in-context learning is known to be highly sensitive to various aspects of the demonstrations [80, 148], and its inference compute cost and absolute performance scale poorly with the number of shots beyond this low-data regime. There may be opportunities to combine few-shot learning methods to leverage their complementary benefits.",

In terms of societal impacts, Flamingo offers a number of benefits while carrying some risks. Its ability to rapidly adapt to a broad range of tasks have the potential to enable non-expert users to obtain good performance in data-starved regimes, lowering the barriers to both beneficial and malicious applications. Flamingo is exposed to the same risks as large language models, such as outputting offensive language, propagating social biases and stereotypes, as well as leaking private information [42, 126]. Its ability to additionally handle visual inputs poses specific risks such as gender and racial biases relating to the contents of the input images, similar to a number of visual recognition systems",

Finally we note that, following prior work focusing on language models [72, 81, 111], the few-shot capabilities of Flamingo could be useful for mitigating such risks.\n\nConclusion. We proposed Flamingo, a general-purpose family of models that can be applied to image and video tasks with minimal task-specific training data. We also qualitatively explored interactive abilities of Flamingo such as 'chatting' with the model, demonstrating flexibility beyond traditional vision benchmarks.",

Our Perceiver Resampler is similar in spirit to the Perceiver models proposed by Jaegle et al. [48]. We learn a predefined number of latent input queries, and cross-attend to the flattened visual features 𝑋 𝑓 . These visual features 𝑋 𝑓 are obtained by first adding a learnt temporal position encoding to each feature within a given video frame (an image being considered as a single-frame video). Note that we only use temporal encodings and no explicit spatial grid position encodings; we did not observe improvements from the latter. This rationale behind is likely that CNNs, such as our NFNet encoder, are known to implicitly include spatial information channel-wise [47]. The visual features are then flattened and concatenated as illustrated in Figure 5.",

In the absence of few-shot examples, approaches commonly rely on prompt engineering [85] to condition the model at inference using a suitable natural language description of the task. Validation of such prompts can significantly impact performance but requires access to a number of annotated examples and cannot therefore be considered truly zero-shot. Furthermore, Perez et al. [80] have shown that such validation procedures are generally not robust with access to only a handful of samples during validation. To report zero-shot performance in our work, we instead build a prompt with two examples from the downstream tasks where we remove their corresponding images or videos .",

In such situations, it is appealing to use a form of prompt selection to both limit the sequence length as well as potentially improve the prompt quality which can in turn lead to better performance [63]. In particular, we follow the Retrieval-based In-Context Example Selection (RICES) approach introduced by [136]. In detail, given a query image, we retrieve similar images in the support set by comparing the visual features extracted from our frozen pretrained visual encoder. We then build the prompt by concatenating the top𝑁 most similar examples. Since LMs are sensitive to the ordering in the prompt due to recency bias [148], we order the examples by increasing order of similarity, such that the most similar support example appears right before the query.",

We use a custom scraper to extract salient content from the remaining documents, in the form of plain text interleaved with images, as described in Section 2.4.

This increase in resolution also comes with only a moderate computational and memory cost as no backpropagation is performed through the frozen Vision Encoder. We also employ random left/right flips and color augmentation.\n\nFor interleaved datasets (Section 2.4) we also employ augmentation by lightly randomizing the selected image indices 𝜑 with a hyperparameter 𝑝 𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 when sampling examples from the M3W dataset. This augmentation is detailed in Appendix A.3.2 and our choice of 𝑝 𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 = 1 2 is ablated in Appendix B.3.1.",

If those are not taken into account, as is often the case in practice, few-shot performance can be overestimated [80]. Similarly, cross-validation of benchmark-specific hyperparameters such as the prompt should be considered as a particularly basic few-shot learning method, where one selects the task-specific prompt over the set of shots. But other learning approaches might be more effective in making use of these labelled examples. Given the negative results reported by [80] in terms of the robustness of cross-validation and unless mentioned otherwise, all benchmarks are run using a single set of evaluation hyperparameters, including the prompts. We optimize hyperparameters jointly across the validation subsets of the DEV benchmarks and do not perform any benchmark-specific cross-validation of hyperparameters, aside from a few exceptions, as we detail",

Second, given that few-shot classification tasks often come with more training examples (e.g., 1000 for ImageNet with 1 example per class), using methods to scale to larger support sets is beneficial. RICES (Retrieval In-Context Example Selection [136] described in Appendix A.2) performs substantially better than simply selecting examples randomly for inclusion in the prompt. Indeed, Flamingo achieves a 9 . 2% improvement in ImageNet classification when selecting 16 support examples out of 5000 using RICES, compared to choosing the same number of examples randomly.

[133]).\n\nAlthough these fine-tuning results come at high computational cost relative to the previously presented in-context few-shot learning results - among other challenges like hyperparameter tuning - they further demonstrate the power of VLM pretraining for visual understanding even in the presence of large amounts of task-specific training data.\n\nIn some cases our results likely trail the state of the art due in part to the fact that we simply optimise log-likelihood and do not make use of common task-specific metric optimisation tricks, such as CIDEr optimisation [64, 90] for COCO captioning, and fine-tuning on dense annotations for VisDial [79]. For example, Murahari et al. [79] report a 10% relative improvement in NDCG on VisDial from such dense annotation fine-tuning.",

We report zero-shot image classification results on ImageNet, Kinetics700 and retrieval results on Flick30K and COCO. The classification results are presented in Table 7 while the retrieval results are given in Table 9. For the retrieval tasks, our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art contrastive dual encoder approaches CLIP [85], ALIGN [50] and Florence [140]. However, we underperform the zero-shot state-of-the-art on Kinetics700 (CLIP) and the zero-shot state-of-the-art on ImageNet (BASIC). However, as noted earlier, BASIC [82] is particularly optimized for classification: it is trained on the JFT-3B [145] dataset which has images with labels rather than captions.",

In the interleaved image-text scenario, we ablate whether the model can only attend to the single most recent previous image, or to all the previous images (row (ii) of Table 10). We can see that the single image case leads to significantly better results ( 7 . 2% better in the overall score). One potential explanation is that when attending to all previous images, there is no explicit way of disambiguating between different images in the cross-attention inputs.

In order to co-train on MassiveText, we need to unfreeze the language model but we keep the vision encoder frozen. We perform two ablations in row (vi) of Table 10: starting from a pretrained language model (with a learning rate multiplier of 0 . 1 of the LM weights) versus initializing from scratch (with the same learning rate everywhere). In both cases, the overall scores are worse than our baseline which starts from the language model, pretrained on MassiveText, and is kept frozen throughout training. This indicates that the strategy of freezing the language model to avoid catastrophic forgetting is beneficial. Even more importantly, freezing the LM is computationally cheaper as no gradient updates of the LMweights are required and we do not need to train on an additional dataset.",

We believe this is because the contrastive training objective directly optimizes for text-image retrieval, and in practice, the evaluation procedure for classification can be thought of as a special case of image-to-text retrieval [85]. This is not the case for the language modeling objective we use to train our visual language models and this may contribute to the observed performance gap on classification tasks.

For instance, causal modeling of the conditioning inputs is strictly less expressive than bidirectional modeling. In this direction, recent work has shown that non-causal masked language modeling adaptation [120] followed by multitask fine-tuning [95, 125, 131] can efficiently improve the zero-shot performance of causal decoder-only language models.

A sequence of 32 VisDial shots is thus composed of at least 32 × 21 = 672 sentences, which in practice means that the prompt length ranges from 4096 to 8192 tokens. This is significantly longer than the maximum sequence length ( 2048 ) our LMs have been trained on [42]. To this end, we have capped our reported results on VisDial at 16 shots.

A sequence of 32 VisDial shots is thus composed of at least 32 × 21 = 672 sentences, which In summary, there is no 'golden' few-shot method that would work well in all scenarios.

Broadly, the fact that Flamingo is capable of task generalisation makes it suitable for use cases that have not been the focus of vision research historically. Typical vision systems are trained to solve a particular problem by training on large databases of manually annotated task-specific examples, making them poorly suited for applications outside of the narrow use cases for which they were deliberately trained. On the other hand, Flamingo is trained in a minimally constrained setting, endowing it with strong few-shot task induction capabilities. As we've shown in our qualitative examples (Appendix C), Flamingo can also be used through a 'chat'-like interface for open-ended dialogue.",

From a modeling perspective, although Flamingo is computationally expensive to train, it importantly leverages pretrained frozen language models and visual encoders. We demonstrated that new modalities can be introduced into frozen models, thereby avoiding expensive retraining. As such models continue to grow in size and computational demands, 'recycling' them will become increasingly important from an environmental perspective (as well as a practical one), as described in Larochelle [55] and explored in Strubell et al.

In particular, we refer to the analysis presented in the Chinchilla paper (Hoffmann et al. [42], Section 4.2.7) in terms of gender bias on the Winogender dataset [93] which demonstrate that even though this model is less biased towards gender than previous models [86], gender biases are still present.

For AI systems to be useful to society as a whole, their performance should not depend on the perceived skin tone or gender of the subjects - they should work equally well for all populations. However, current automatic vision system performance has been reported to vary with race, gender or when applied across different demographics and geographic regions [12, 21, 97]. As a preliminary study assessing how Flamingo's performance varies between populations, we follow the study proposed in Zhao et al. [147] and report how the captioning performance of our model varies on COCO as a function of gender and race. Note that we use a different evaluation protocol from the one proposed by Zhao et al. [147]; in that work, they measure results across 5 pretrained models and compute confidence intervals across aggregated per-model scores.",

Thanks to its ability to rapidly adapt in lowresource settings, Flamingo could itself be applied in addressing some of the issues described above. For instance, following Thoppilan et al.

In their work, they observe significant improvements relating to safety and quality when fine-tuning on the resulting data.

This was tested either in an open ended setting where Flamingo generate language and we compare the outputs with the ground truth or in a close ended setting where we directly score various outcomes us- ing the likelihood of the model.   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Decision thresholds                       | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Approaches to Uncertainty and Variability | Due to the costs of training Flamingo , we cannot train it multiple times.
