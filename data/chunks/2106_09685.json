As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks.

(2020) which show that the learned over-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the change in weights during model adaptation also has a low 'intrinsic rank', leading to our proposed Lo wR ank A daptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural network indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers' change during adaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3 175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., r in Figure 1 can be one or two) suffices even when the full rank (i.e., d ) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-efficient.",

Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens of works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-efficient. See Section 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there are two prominent strategies when it comes to efficient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuffi et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R¨ uckl´ e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms of the input layer activations (Li &amp; Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and latency-sensitive production scenario.\n\nAdapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency There are many variants of adapters.

While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploiting multi-task settings (R¨ uckl´ e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass the extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed to have few parameters (sometimes &lt; 1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck dimension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware parallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially.

This makes a difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a generic scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) medium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a very small bottleneck dimension (Table 1).\n\nThis problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in Shoeybi et al.

Inspired by this, we hypothesize the updates to the weights also have a low 'intrinsic rank' during adaptation. For a pre-trained weight matrix W 0 ∈ R d × k , we constrain its update by representing the latter with a low-rank decomposition W 0 +∆ W = W 0 + BA , where B ∈ R d × r , A ∈ R r × k , and the rank r glyph[lessmuch] min( d, k ) .

When optimizing with Adam, tuning α is roughly the same as tuning the learning rate if we scale the initialization appropriately. As a result, we simply set α to the first r we try and do not tune it.

For a large Transformer trained with Adam, we reduce that VRAM usage by up to 2 / 3 if r glyph[lessmuch] d model as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen parameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from 1.2TB to 350GB. With r = 4 and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the checkpoint size is reduced by roughly 10,000 × (from 350GB to 35MB) 4 .

Contemporarily, this baseline has also been studied by BitFit (Zaken et al., 2021).\n\nPrefix-embedding tuning (PreEmbed) inserts special tokens among the input tokens. These special tokens have trainable word embeddings and are generally not in the model's vocabulary. Where to place such tokens can have an impact on performance. We focus on 'prefixing', which prepends such tokens to the prompt, and 'infixing', which appends to the prompt; both are discussed in Li &amp; Liang (2021). We use l p (resp. l i ) denote the number of prefix (resp. infix) tokens. The number of trainable parameters is | Θ | = d model × ( l p + l i ) .",

Instead of just learning the word embeddings (or equivalently, the activations after the embedding layer) for some special tokens, we learn the activations after every Transformer layer. The activations computed from previous layers are simply replaced by trainable ones. The resulting number of trainable parameters is | Θ | = L × d model × ( l p + l i ) , where L is the number of Transformer layers.\n\nAdapter tuning as proposed in Houlsby et al.

While RoBERTa has been overtaken by much larger models on NLP leaderboards such as the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019) in recent years, it remains a competitive and popular pre-trained model for its size among practitioners. We take the pre-trained RoBERTa base (125M) and RoBERTa large (355M) from the HuggingFace Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020) and evaluate the performance of different efficient adaptation approaches on tasks from the GLUE benchmark. We also replicate Houlsby et al. (2019) and Pfeiffer et al. (2021) according to their setup.

A new paradigm emerged with BERT (Devlin et al., 2019b) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) - both are large Transformer lan-\n\nguage models trained on a large amount of text - where fine-tuning on task-specific data after pretraining on general domain data provides a significant performance gain compared to training on task-specific data directly.

Fine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a specific task Devlin et al. (2019b); Radford et al. (a). Variants of it include learning just a subset of the parameters Devlin et al. (2019b); Collobert &amp; Weston (2008), yet practitioners often retrain all of them to maximize the downstream performance.",

However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform fine-tuning in the usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it has the same memory footprint as pre-training.\n\nParameter-Efficient Adaptation. Many have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing layers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuffi et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method uses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The key functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during inference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3).",

A comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially parametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing scheme. Similarly, combining LoRA with other tensor product-based methods could potentially improve its parameter efficiency, which we leave to future work. More recently, many proposed optimizing the input word embeddings in lieu of fine-tuning, akin to a continuous and differentiable generalization of prompt engineering (Li &amp; Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021).

Low-rank structure is very common in machine learning. A lot of machine learning problems have certain intrinsic low-rank structure (Li et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2010; Li et al., 2018b; Grasedyck et al., 2013). Moreover, it is known that for many deep learning tasks, especially those with a heavily over-parametrized neural network, the learned neural network will enjoy low-rank properties after training (Oymak et al., 2019).",

This suggests the update matrix ∆ W could have a very small 'intrinsic rank'. 6 To further support this finding, we check the overlap of the subspaces learned by different choices of r and by different random seeds. We argue that increasing r does not cover a more meaningful subspace, which suggests that a low-rank adaptation matrix is sufficient.",

Second, instead of repeating the top singular directions of W , ∆ W only amplifies directions that are not emphasized in W . Third, the amplification factor is rather huge: 21 . 5 ≈ 6 . 91 / 0 . 32 for r = 4 . See Section H.4 for why r = 64 has a smaller amplification factor. We also provide a visualization in Section H.3 for how the correlation changes as we include more top singular directions from W q .

However, in practice, we can often afford to curate a few thousand or more training examples for performance-sensitive applications.

We take the GPT-3 few-shot result on RTE from the GPT-3 paper (Brown et al., 2020).

Consequently, adapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional latency. While as pointed out in R¨ uckl´ e et al. (2020), the latency introduced by adapter layers can be mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the hardware parallelism. We confirm their observation with a similar latency study on GPT-2 medium and point out that there are scenarios, notably online inference where the batch size is small, where the added latency can be significant.\n\nWe measure the latency of a single forward pass on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 by averaging over 100 trials. We vary the input batch size, sequence length, and the adapter bottleneck dimension r . We test two adapter designs: the original one by Houlsby et al.",

Larger batch size and sequence length help to mitigate the latency, but the slow-down can be as high as over 30% in an online, short-sequence-length scenario.

For more on prefix-layer tuning, see Section 5.1.\n\nIn Table 15, we show the evaluation results of LoRA+PE and LoRA+PL on WikiSQL and MultiNLI. First of all, LoRA+PE significantly outperforms both LoRA and prefix-embedding tuning on WikiSQL, which indicates that LoRA is somewhat orthogonal to prefix-embedding tuning. On MultiNLI, the combination of LoRA+PE doesn't perform better than LoRA, possibly because LoRA on its own already achieves performance comparable to the human baseline. Secondly, we notice that LoRA+PL performs slightly worse than LoRA even with more trainable parameters. We attribute this to the fact that prefix-layer tuning is very sensitive to the choice of learning rate and thus makes the optimization of LoRA weights more difficult in LoRA+PL.",

In Table 16, we show the performance of different adaptation approaches on MNLIn . To our surprise, PrefixEmbed and PrefixLayer performs very poorly on MNLI-100 dataset, with PrefixEmbed performing only slightly better than random chance (37.6% vs. 33.3%). PrefixLayer performs better than PrefixEmbed but is still significantly worse than Fine-Tune or LoRA on MNLI100. The gap between prefix-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we increase the number of training examples, which might suggest that prefix-based approaches are not suitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3. LoRA achieves better performance than fine-tuning on both MNLI-100 and MNLI-Full, and comparable results on MNLI-1k and MNLI-10K considering the ( ± 0 . 3 ) variance due to random seeds.",

LoRA achieves better performance than fine-tuning on both MNLI-100 and MNLI-Full, and comparable results on MNLI-1k and MNLI-10K considering the ( ± 0 . 3 ) variance due to random seeds.\n\nThe training hyperparameters of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-n are reported in Table 17. We use a smaller learning rate for PrefixLayer on the MNLI-100 set, as the training loss does not decrease with a larger learning rate.",

As shown in Section 7.3, for r = 4 , this amplification factor is as large as 20. In other words, there are (generally speaking) four feature directions in each layer (out of the entire feature space from the pre-trained model W ), that need to be amplified by a very large factor 20, in order to achieve our reported accuracy for the downstream specific task. And, one should expect a very different set of feature directions to be amplified for each different downstream task.",
