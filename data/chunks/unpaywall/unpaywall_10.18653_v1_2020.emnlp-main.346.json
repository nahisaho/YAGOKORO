Reformulating tasks as fillin-the-blanks problems (e.g., cloze tests) is a natural approach for gauging such knowledge, however, its usage is limited by the manual effort and guesswork required to write suitable prompts. To address this, we develop AUTOPROMPT, an automated method to create prompts for a diverse set of tasks, based on a gradient-guided search. Using AUTOPROMPT, we show that masked language models (MLMs) have an inherent capability to perform sentiment analysis and natural language inference without additional parameters or finetuning, sometimes achieving performance on par with recent state-of-the-art supervised models. We also show that our prompts elicit more accurate factual knowledge from MLMs than the manually created prompts on the LAMA benchmark, and that MLMs can be used as relation extractors more effectively than supervised relation extraction models. These results demonstrate that automatically generated prompts are a viable parameter-free alternative to existing probing methods, and as pretrained LMs become more sophisticated and capable, potentially a replacement for finetuning.",

Although it is clear that pretraining improves accuracy, it is difficult to determine whether the knowledge that finetuned LMs contain is learned during the pretraining or the finetuning process.

A common strategy is to use probing classifiers-shallow classifiers that predict certain attributes using an LMs' representations as features (Conneau et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). However, probing classifiers require additional learned parameters and are thus susceptible to false positives; high probing accuracy is not a sufficient condition to conclude that an LM contains a certain piece of knowledge (Hewitt and Liang, 2019; Voita and Titov, 2020). Attention visualization, another common technique, has a similar failure mode: attention scores may be correlated with, but not caused by the underlying target knowledge, leading to criticism against their use as explanations (Jain and Wallace, 2019; Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019). Both probing and attention visualizations also struggle to evaluate knowledge that cannot be represented as simple token- or sequencelevel classification tasks.",

For example, Radford et al. (2019) frame summarization as a language modeling task by appending 'TL;DR:' to the end of an article and then generating from an LM. Similarly, Petroni et al. (2019) manually reformulate a knowledge base completion task as a cloze test (i.e., a fill-in-the-blank problem). Compared to existing model analysis methods, prompting is noninvasive: it does not introduce large amounts of additional parameters or require direct inspection of a model's representations.

First, we use AUTOPROMPT to construct prompts that test pretrained masked language models (MLMs) on sentiment analysis and natural language inference (NLI). Our tests reveal that, without any finetuning, MLMs perform well on both of these tasks-a properlyprompted RoBERTa achieves 91% accuracy on SST-2 (better than a finetuned ELMo model (Peters et al., 2018)), and 69% accuracy on a bal- anced variant of the SICK-E dataset (Marelli et al., 2014). Next, we apply AUTOPROMPT to the fact retrieval tasks of LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019), where we are able to construct prompts that more effectively elicit MLM's factual knowledge than existing prompts generated using manual and corpusmining methods. Concretely, we achieve 43.3% precision-at-1, compared to the current best singleprompt result of 34.1% (Jiang et al., 2020). We also introduce a variant of this task, similar to relation extraction (RE), that tests whether MLMs can extract knowledge from a given piece of text. We show that MLMs can actually outperform existing RE models when context sentences with real facts are provided, however, they struggle when context sentences are artificially falsified.",

First, AUTOPROMPT achieves higher average- and worstcase accuracy than finetuning in low-data regimes. Moreover, unlike finetuning, prompting LMs does not require large amounts of disk space to store model checkpoints; once a prompt is found, it can be used on off-the-shelf pretrained LMs. This is beneficial when serving models for multiple tasks.\n\n## 2 Overview of AUTOPROMPT",

The prompt is constructed by taking the original task inputs-a collection of one or more sequences of tokens (e.g., the review in Figure 1)-and mapping them to a sequence of tokens using a template.

Here, we propose a method for automatic prompt construction based on Wallace et al. (2019). The idea is to add a number of 'trigger' tokens that are shared across all prompts (denoted by [T] in the example template in Figure 1). These tokens are initialized to [MASK] tokens, and then iteratively updated to maximize the label likelihood (Equation (1)) over batches of examples.\n\nFormally, at each step, we compute a first-order approximation of the change in the log-likelihood that would be produced by swapping the j th trigger token x ( j ) trig with another token w ∈ V . Then we identify a candidate set V cand of the topk tokens estimated to cause the greatest increase:",

Note that computing this candidate set is roughly as expensive as a single forward pass and backward pass of the model (the dot-products require the same amount of multiplications as computing the LM output projection). For each candidate in this set, we then re-evaluate Equation (1) on the updated prompt, and retain the prompt with the highest probability in the next step-this requires k forward passes of the model. An example prompt produced by this method for the task of sentiment analysis is shown in Figure 1.\n\n## 2.3 Automating Label Token Selection",

In this section, we develop a general two-step approach to automate the selection of the sets of label tokens V y . In the first step, we train a logistic classifier to predict the class label using the contextualized embedding of the [MASK] token as input:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe write the output of this classifier as:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere y and β y are the learned weight and bias terms for the label y , and i represents the index of the [MASK] token.",

The LAMA dataset (Petroni et al., 2019) evaluates this using cloze tests that consist of (sub, rel, obj) triples, e.g. ( Obama , bornIn , Hawaii ), and manually created prompts with missing objects, e.g. ' Obama was born in [MASK]. '. LPAQA (Jiang et al., 2020) extends this idea by systematically creating prompts that are generated by mining Wikipedia, paraphrasing, and crowdsourcing. In this section, we use the same cloze-style setup but automatically generate prompts in order to better evaluate the factual knowledge of MLMs. We compare our approach against LAMA and LPAQA, which are explicitly designed for the task of fact retrieval.",

We use the original test set from LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019), henceforth Original .

For the relations that still have less than 1000 samples, we gather extra facts straight from Wikidata. We ensure that none of the T-REx triples are present in the test set, and we split the data 80-20 into train and development sets. Moreover, because the collected T-REx data is from a slightly different distribution than the LAMA test set, we also consider a separate evaluation where we split the T-REx triples into a 60-20-20 train/dev/test split and evaluate on the test set.

We create RE prompts in a similar fashion as fact retrieval: for a given triple (subj,rel,obj) and sentence that expresses this relation, we construct a prompt as ' { sent }{ sub } [T]. . . [T][P].

(2019). To make the evaluation fair for the supervised RE model, we modify the standard RE evaluation. We give the model credit as long as it does not predict a different relation for the subject and object, i.e. we ignore the 'no relation' prediction and all other relations. We also drop all sentences from evaluation for which the model's named entity extractor failed to identify the subject and the object as entities. See Appendix B for further details. For the evaluation of all systems, we treat a prediction as correct if it is either the canonical version of the object (e.g., 'USA') or the rendered surface form (e.g., 'American') for any of the context sentences in a given triple.",

MLMs can extract relational information more effectively than the supervised RE model, providing up to a 33% increase on the task when using AUTOPROMPT. RoBERTa also outperforms the supervised RE model, although it is worse than BERT (likely for similar reasons as we outline in Section 5).

Thus, they may directly predict the objects instead of extracting them. To separate this effect, we synthetically perturb the relation extraction dataset by replacing each object in the test data with a random other object and making the same change to the prompt.

However, we cannot conclude that BERT does not know paraphrasing or entailment from these results.

Although this is also required for other probing techniques (e.g., linear probing classifiers), manual prompts rely on domain/language insights instead of labeled data. Compared to human-designed prompts, AUTOPROMPT generated prompts lack interpretability, which is similar to other probing techniques, such as linear probing classifiers. Another limitation of AUTOPROMPT is that it can sometimes struggle when the training data is highly imbalanced. For example, in Sections 4 and 5 we show that the prompts often just increase the likelihood of the majority label. Re- balancing the training data can help to mitigate this problem. Finally, due to the greedy search over the large discrete space of phrases, AUTOPROMPT is sometimes brittle; we leave more effective crafting techniques for future directions.",

We show that these prompts outperform manual prompts while requiring less human effort. Furthermore, the results for sentiment analysis and textual entailment suggest that, in some data-scarce settings, it may be more effective to prompt language models than to finetune them for the task. Although we focus only on masked language models in this paper, our method can be trivially extended to standard language models, and thus maybe useful for constructing inputs for models like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020).

We feed the RE model sentences from test facts and we query the resulting graph for all edges that contain the given subject and relation. Then we select the triple with the highest confidence and compare it's object to the gold object. We do this for every fact and take the average across all relations to get the overall precision. The RE model is not trained to predict two of the original T-REx relations. For fair comparison, we exclude these two relations for our evaluation.\n\n## C Additional Fact Retrieval Results",
