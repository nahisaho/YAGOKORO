Each objective employs a different attention masking strategy between queries and text to control their interaction (see Figure 2).\n\nImage-Text Contrastive Learning (ITC) learns to align image representation and text representation such that their mutual information is maximized.

We employ a multimodal causal self-attention mask to control query-text interaction, similar to the one used in UniLM (Dong et al., 2019).

The projected query embeddings are then prepended to the input text embeddings. They function as soft visual prompts that condition the LLM on visual representation extracted by the Q-Former. Since the Q-Former has been pre-trained to extract language-informative visual representation, it effectively functions as an information bottleneck that feeds the most useful information to the LLM while removing irrelevant visual information.

Figure 4 shows examples to demonstrate a wide range of zero-shot image-to-text capabilities including visual knowledge reasoning, visual commensense reasoning, visual conversation, personalized image-to-text generation, etc.\n\nZero-shot VQA . We perform quantitative evaluation on the zero-shot visual question answering task. For OPT models, we use the prompt 'Question: {} Answer:'. For FlanT5 models, we use the prompt 'Question: {} Short answer:'. During generation, we use beam search with a beam width of 5. We also set the length-penalty to -1 which encourages shorter answers that align better with human annotation.",

It outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on VQAv2, despite having 54x fewer trainable parameters. On the OK-VQA (Marino et al., 2019) dataset, BLIP-2 comes secondary to Flamingo80B. We hypothesis that this is because OK-VQA focuses more on open-world knowledge than visual understanding, and the 70B Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022) language model from Flamingo80B possesses more knowledge than the 11B FlanT5XXL.\n\nWe make a promising observation from Table 2: a stronger image encoder or a stronger LLM both lead to better performance.

We keep the LLM frozen during finetuning, and updates the parameters of the Q-Former together with the image encoder. We experiment with ViT-g and various LLMs. Detailed hyperparameters can be found in the appendix.

We finetune with the open-ended answer generation loss, where the LLM receives Q-Former's output and the question as input, and is asked to generate the answer. In order to extract image features that are more relevant to the question, we additionally condition Q-Former on the question. Specifically, the question tokens are given as input to the Q-Former and interact with the queries via the self-attention layers, which can guide the Q-Former's crossattention layers to focus on more informative image regions.\n\nFollowing BLIP, our VQA data includes the training and validation splits from VQAv2, as well as training samples from Visual Genome. Table 4 demonstrates the state-of-theart results of BLIP-2 among open-ended generation models.\n\nBLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models",

Specifically, we finetune the image encoder together with Q-Former on COCO using the same objectives ( i . e . ITC, ITM, and ITG) as pre-training. We then evaluate the model for both image-to-text retrieval and text-to-image retrieval on COCO and Flickr30K (Plummer et al., 2015) datasets. During inference, we follow Li et al. (2021; 2022) which first select k = 128 candidates based on the imagetext feature similarity, followed by a re-ranking based on pairwise ITM scores. We experiment with both ViT-L and ViT-g as the image encoder. Detailed hyperparameters can be found in the appendix.\n\nThe results are shown in Table 5. BLIP-2 achieves stateof-the-art performance with significant improvement over existing methods on zero-shot image-text retrieval.",

BLIP-2 achieves stateof-the-art performance with significant improvement over existing methods on zero-shot image-text retrieval.\n\nThe ITC and ITM losses are essential for image-text retrieval as they directly learn image-text similarity. In Table 6, we show that the ITG (image-grounded text generation) loss is also beneficial for image-text retrieval. This result supports our intuition in designing the representation learning objectives: the ITG loss enforces the queries to extract visual features most relevant to the text, thus improving visionlanguage alignment.",

However, our experiments with BLIP-2 do not observe an improved VQA performance when providing the LLM with in-context VQA examples. We attribute the lack of in-context learning capability to our pretraining dataset, which only contains a single image-text pair per sample. The LLMs cannot learn from it the correlation among multiple image-text pairs in a single sequence. The same observation is also reported in the Flamingo paper, which uses a close-sourced interleaved image and text dataset (M3W) with multiple image-text pairs per sequence. We aim to create a similar dataset in future work.\n\nBLIP-2's image-to-text generation could have unsatisfactory results due to various reasons including inaccurate knowledge from the LLM, activating the incorrect reasoning path, or not having up-to-date information about new image content (see Figure 7).",
