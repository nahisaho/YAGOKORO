    "abstract": "Scaling up language models has been shown to predictably improve performance and sample efficiency on a wide range of downstream tasks. This paper instead discusses an unpredictable phenomenon that we refer to as emergent abilities of large language models. We consider an ability to be emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models. Thus, emergent abilities cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models. The existence of such emergence implies that additional scaling could further expand the range of capabilities of language models.",

It is now well-known that increasing the scale of language models (e.g., training compute, model parameters, etc.) can lead to better performance and sample efficiency on a range of downstream NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020, inter alia ). In many cases, the effect of scale on performance can often be methodologically predicted via scaling laws-for example, scaling curves for cross-entropy loss have been shown to empirically span more than seven orders of magnitude (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). On the other hand, performance for certain downstream tasks counterintuitively does not appear to continuously improve as a function of scale, and such tasks cannot be predicted ahead of time (Ganguli et al., 2022).",

Specifically, we define emergent abilities of large language models as abilities that are not present in smaller-scale models but are present in large-scale models; thus they cannot be predicted by simply extrapolating the performance improvements on smaller-scale models (§2). 1 We survey emergent abilities as observed in a range of prior work, categorizing them in settings such as few-shot prompting (§3) and augmented prompting strategies (§4). Emergence motivates future research on why such abilities are acquired and whether more scaling will lead to further emergent abilities, which we highlight as important questions for the field (§5).",

When visualized via a scaling curve ( x -axis: model scale, y -axis: performance), emergent abilities show a clear pattern-performance is near-random until a certain critical threshold of scale is reached, after which performance increases to substantially above random. This qualitative change is also known as a phase transition -a dramatic change in overall behavior that would not have been foreseen by examining smaller-scale systems (Huberman &amp; Hogg, 1987).",

This qualitative change is also known as a phase transition -a dramatic change in overall behavior that would not have been foreseen by examining smaller-scale systems (Huberman &amp; Hogg, 1987).\n\nToday's language models have been scaled primarily along three factors: amount of computation, number of model parameters, and training dataset size (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). In this paper, we will analyze scaling curves by plotting the performance of different models where training compute for each model is measured in FLOPs on the x -axis (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Because language models trained with more compute tend to also have more parameters, we additionally show plots with number of model parameters as the x -axis in Appendix D (see Figure 11 and Figure 12, as well as Figure 4 and Figure 10).",

Although we focus on training computation and model size here, there is not a single proxy that adequately captures all aspects of scale. For example, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022) has one-fourth as many parameters as Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) but uses similar training compute; and sparse mixture-of-expert models have more parameters per training/inference compute than dense models (Fedus et al., 2021; Du et al., 2021). Overall, it may be wise to view emergence as a function of many correlated variables. For example, later in Figure 4 we will also plot emergence as a function of WikiText103 perplexity (Merity et al., 2016), which happens to closely correlate with training computation for Gopher/ Chinchilla (though this correlation may not hold in the long-run).",

As shown in Figure 3A, chain of thought prompting only surpasses standard prompting without intermediate steps when scaled to 10 23 training FLOPs ( ∼ 100B parameters). A similar emergence in performance gain was also observed when augmenting few-shot prompting with explanations that came after the final answer (Lampinen et al., 2022).\n\nInstruction following. Another growing line of work aims to better enable language models to perform new tasks simply by reading instructions describing the task (without few-shot exemplars). By finetuning on a mixture of tasks phrased as instructions, language models have been shown to respond appropriately to instructions describing an unseen task (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022). As shown in Figure 3B, Wei et al.",

Finally, an important direction for deployment of language models studies is calibration , which measures whether models can predict which questions they will be able to answer correctly. Kadavath et al. (2022) compared two ways of measuring calibration: a True/False technique, where models first propose answers and then evaluate the probability 'P(True)' that their answers are correct, and more-standard methods of calibration, which use the probability of the correct answer compared with other answer options.",

Emergent few-shot prompted tasks are also unpredictable in the sense that these tasks are not explicitly included in pre-training, and we likely do not know the full scope of few-shot prompted tasks that language models can perform. This raises the question of whether further scaling could potentially endow even-larger language models with new emergent abilities.

For certain tasks, there may be natural intuitions for why emergence requires a model larger than a particular threshold scale. For instance, if a multi-step reasoning task requires l steps of sequential computation, this might require a model with a depth of at least O ( l ) layers. It is also reasonable to assume that more parameters and more training enable better memorization that could be helpful for tasks requiring world knowledge. 4 As an example, good performance on closed-book question-answering may require a model with enough parameters to capture the compressed knowledge base itself (though language model-based compressors can have higher compression ratios than conventional compressors (Bellard, 2021)).",

Similar logic may apply for multi-step or arithmetic reasoning problems, where models are only scored on whether they get the final answer to a multi-step problem correct, without any credit given to partially correct solutions.

For instance, NLP has historically focused on task-specific models (Jurafsky &amp; Martin, 2009). Recently, scaling has led to an explosion in research on and development of models that are 'general purpose' in that they are single models that aim to perform a range of tasks not explicitly encoded in the training data (e.g., GPT-3, Chinchilla, and PaLM) (Manning, 2022).\n\nOne key set of results in the emergent sociological shift towards general-purpose models is when scaling enables a few-shot prompted general-purpose model to outperform prior state of the art held by finetuned task-specific models.",

The other three tasks are classification and use accuracy (acc) as the evaluation metric.\n\nIn the scaling curves for these tasks, peformance in EM/BLEU/acc is close to random for small models ( ≤ 10 22 FLOPs / ≤ 27B params). We will compare these scaling curves against alternative plots that have a different y -axis measured by cross-entropy loss.

For all three tasks, the emergent behavior appears to be independent of which evaluation metric is used. Hence, we conclude that using exact string match instead of another evaluation metric that awards partial credit is not a complete explanation of emergence on generative tasks.

For this analysis, we manually classified all 210 BIG-Bench tasks as thus far emergent or not. We used the definition of emergence given in §3, which is that the task had near-random performance until a certain scale, after which performance increases to substantially above random (as opposed to smoothly increasing). Because this definition is potentially subjective based on the definition of 'near-random' (and any heuristic we decide on would encode these subjective biases), two co-authors of the paper worked together and agreed with confidence on all the tasks labeled as emergent.

For full transparency, this set of annotations is listed in Appendix E.\n\nIn Figure 8, we show the number of tasks that are emergent for each keyword in BIG-Bench. Furthermore, we stratify them by tasks that first emerged with LaMDA 137B or GPT-3 175B, as well as tasks that were not emergent until using PaLM models. The non-emergent tasks in this plot include either 'smoothly increasing' tasks (performance predictably increased with model size) or 'flat' tasks (all models achieved approximately random performance). The remaining 40 BIG-Bench tasks not included in this chart did not fit into any of the above categories (e.g., too noisy due to very few eval examples, performance not correlated with model scale, etc.).",

Because MMLU is actually a suite of 57 topics spanning four categories, we ask the question of whether certain categories were more conducive to emergence than others. This is similar in nature to the BIG-Bench analysis done in the prior section (Appendix A.3). One difference here is that the MMLU categories are mutually exclusive-each topic only has one category, whereas a single BIG-Bench task often had multiple keyword tags. However, there are only four categories and 57 tasks for MMLU (compared with 200+ tasks and dozens of keywords for BIG-Bench).\n\nIn Figure 10, we stratify the performance of MMLU among the four categories given in the benchmark (Humanities, STEM, Social Science, and other), and plot them with multiple x -axes: training FLOPs, model parameters, and WikiText103 perplexity.",
