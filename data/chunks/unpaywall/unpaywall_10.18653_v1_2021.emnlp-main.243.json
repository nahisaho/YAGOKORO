Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3's few-shot learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method 'closes the gap' and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed 'prefix tuning' of Li and Liang (2021) and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches. Finally, we show that conditioning a frozen model with soft prompts confers benefits in robustness to domain transfer and enables efficient 'prompt ensembling.' We release code and model checkpoints to reproduce our experiments. 1",

Prompts are typically composed of a task description and/or several canonical examples. This return to 'freezing' pre-trained models is appealing, especially as model size continues to increase. Rather than requiring a separate copy of the model for each downstream task, a single generalist model can simultaneously serve many different tasks.\n\nUnfortunately, prompt-based adaptation has several key drawbacks.

With a T5 'XXL' model, each copy of the tuned model requires 11 billion parameters.

Normally, prompting is done by prepending a series of tokens, P , to the input X , such that the model maximizes the likelihood of the correct Y , Pr θ ( Y | [ P ; X ]) , while keeping the model parameters, θ , fixed. In GPT-3, the representations of the prompt tokens, P = { p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n } , are part of the model's embedding table, parameterized by the frozen θ . Finding an optimal prompt thus requires the selection of prompt tokens, through either manual search or non-differentiable search methods (Jiang et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020). Prompt tuning removes the restriction that the prompt P be parameterized by θ ; instead the prompt has its own dedicated parameters, θ P , that can be updated. While prompt design involves selecting prompt tokens from a fixed vocabulary of frozen embeddings, prompt tuning can be thought of as using a fixed prompt of special tokens, where only the embeddings of these prompt tokens can be updated. Our new conditional generation is now Pr θ ; θ P ( Y | [ P ; X ]) and can be trained by maximizing the likelihood of Y via backpropagation, while only applying gradient updates to θ P .",

Our models are trained to maximize the probability of Y , but only the prompt parameters P e are updated. ## 2.1 Design Decisions \n\nThere are many possible ways to initialize the prompt representations. The simplest is to train from scratch, using random initialization. A more sophisticated option is to initialize each prompt token to an embedding drawn from the model's vocabulary. Conceptually, our soft-prompt modulates the frozen network's behavior in the same way as text preceding the input, so it follows that a word-like representation might serve as a good initialization spot. For classification tasks, a third option is to initialize the prompt with embeddings that enumerate the output classes, similar to the 'verbalizers' of Schick and Schütze (2021). Since we want the model to produce these tokens in the output, initializing the prompt with the embeddings of the valid target tokens should prime the model to restrict its output to the legal output classes.",

Specifically, T5 is tasked with 'reconstructing' masked spans in the input text, which are marked with unique sentinel tokens. The target output text consists of all the masked content, separated by sentinels, plus a final sentinel. For instance, from the text 'Thank you for inviting me to your party last week' we might construct a pre-training example where the input is 'Thank you 〈 X 〉 me to your party 〈 Y 〉 week' and the target output is ' 〈 X 〉 for inviting 〈 Y 〉 last 〈 Z 〉 '.",

(2020) find this architecture and pre-training objective more effective than traditional language modeling, we hypothesize that this setup is not a good fit for producing a frozen model that can be readily controlled through prompt tuning. In particular, a T5 model pre-trained exclusively on span corruption, such as T5 1.1, has never seen truly natural input text (free of sentinel tokens), nor has it ever been asked to predict truly natural targets. In fact, due to the details of T5's span corruption preprocessing, every pre-training target will begin with a sentinel. While this 'unnatural' tendency to output sentinels is easy to overcome through fine-tuning, we suspect that it would be much harder to override through a prompt alone, as the decoder priors cannot be adjusted.",

For random initialization, we sample uniformly from the range [ -0 . 5 , 0 . 5 ]. When initializing from sampled vocabulary, we restrict to the 5 , 000 most 'common' tokens in T5's SentencePiece vocabulary (Kudo and Richardson, 2018), which is ordered by likelihood in the pre-training corpus. For 'class label' initialization, we take the embeddings for the string representations of each class in the downstream task and use them to initialize one of the tokens in the prompt. 8 When a class label is multi-token, we average the token embeddings. At longer prompt lengths, we often run out of class labels before we have initialized all",

However, as model size increases, ensembling can become impractical. Beyond the space required to store N models (e.g. 42 GiB for each copy of T5-XXL), there is a substantial inference cost to running N distinct models, whether in parallel or in series.",

By training N prompts on the same task, we create N separate 'models' for a task, while still sharing the core language modeling parameters throughout. Beyond drastically reducing storage costs, the prompt ensemble makes inference more efficient. To process one example, rather than computing forward passes of N different models, we can execute a single forward pass with a batch size of N , replicating the example across the batch and varying the prompt.

On the popular SuperGLUE benchmark, its task performance rivals that of traditional model tuning, with the gap vanishing as model size increases. On zeroshot domain transfer, we found that prompt tuning leads to improved generalization. This plausibly indicates that freezing general-purpose language understanding parameters and restricting downstream learning to a lightweight parameter footprint can help to avoid overfitting to a specific domain.",

We reuse the evaluation code from the publicly available T5 open-source release to compute metrics. 12 For the SQuAD and MRQA datasets, we evaluate using F1, one of the metrics used by the SQuAD benchmark, where partial answer spans are considered. Again, we use the T5 open-source release for metric calculation. 13 All of our models use T5 1.1 as the base frozen model, additional details and pretrained checkpoints can be found on GitHub. 14,15\n\nAll prompts for T5 Small and Base models were trained on 4 TPU v2 chips, while prompts for larger models were trained on 16 TPU v3 chips.",

There were an additional 18 runs for the domain shift experiments and 24 extra runs to create the ensemble. Hyperparameter bounds can be found in Table 6. Hyperparameter tuning was done via manual tuning and settings were selected based on the SuperGLUE score. All experiments in this work, outside of the hyperparameter being ablated, use our default configuration of 100K steps of LM Adapation, a prompt length of 100, and 'class-label' initialization.\n\nAll graphs of our experimental results plot the mean and standard deviation over 3 runs as computed by Seaborn (Waskom, 2021).

Figure 4 also shows mean and standard deviation for the number of parameters each method uses as the prompt length varies from 1 -100 . The 'Prefix Tuning (Train)' curves appears to have no standard deviation because the parameter count is so strongly dominated by the cost of the reparameterization parameters that the standard deviation bands are occluded.

For the GLUE 16,17 and SuperGLUE 18 datasets, we used the training, validation, and test splits that ship with TensorFlow Datasets. We used version 1.0.0 for GLUE and 1.0.2 for SuperGLUE datasets. For SQuAD 19 we used v1.1:3.0.0 from Tensorflow Datasets and follow the provided training, validation, and test splits. For the out-of-domain datasets we used the development splits distributed as part of the MRQAshared task. 20 Dataset sizes can be found in Table 7.
