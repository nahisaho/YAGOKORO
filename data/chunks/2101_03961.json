    "title": "Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity",
    "abstract": "In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.",

The result is a sparsely-activated model-with an outrageous number of parameters-but a constant computational cost.

This trade-off is explained in Figure 3. Empirically we find ensuring lower rates of dropped tokens are important for the scaling of sparse expert-models. Throughout our experiments we didn't notice any dependency on the number of experts for the number of tokens dropped (typically &lt; 1%). Using the auxiliary load balancing loss (next section) with a high enough coefficient ensured good load balancing. We study the impact that these design decisions have on model quality and speed in Table 1.\n\nADifferentiable Load Balancing Loss. To encourage a balanced load across experts we add an auxiliary loss (Shazeer et al., 2017, 2018; Lepikhin et al., 2020). As in Shazeer et al. (2018); Lepikhin et al.

We select tasks probing language capabilities including question answering, summarization and knowledge about the world. The language benchmarks GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019) are handled as composite mixtures with all the tasks blended in proportion to the amount of tokens present in each. These benchmarks consist of tasks requiring sentiment analysis (SST2), word sense disambiguation (WIC), sentence similarty (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), natural language inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE, CB), question answering (MultiRC, RECORD, BoolQ), coreference resolution (WNL",

To alleviate this, we study distilling (Hinton et al., 2015) large sparse models into small dense models. Future work could additionally study distilling large models into smaller sparse models.\n\nDistillation techniques. In Table 6 we study a variety of distillation techniques. These techniques are built off of Sanh et al. (2019), who study distillation methods for BERT models. We find that initializing the dense model with the non-expert weights yields a modest improvement. This is possible since all models are FLOP matched, so non-expert layers will have the same dimensions. Since expert layers are usually only added at every or every other FFN layer in a Transformer, this allows for many of the weights to be initialized with trained parameters. Furthermore, we observe a distillation improvement using a mixture of 0.25 for the teacher probabilities and 0.75 for the ground truth label.",

As a preliminary assessment of the model quality, we use a Switch-XXL model partially pre-trained on 503B tokens, or approximately half the text used by the T5-XXL model. Using this checkpoint, we conduct multi-task training for efficiency, where all tasks are learned jointly, rather than individually fine-tuned. We find that SQuAD accuracy on the validation set increases to 89.7 versus state-of-the-art of 91.3. Next, the average SuperGLUE test score is recorded at 87.5 versus the T5 version obtaining a score of 89.3 compared to the state-of-the-art of 90.0 (Wang et al., 2019).

Yes, and by design! Parameters, independent of the total FLOPs used, are a useful axis to scale neural language models. Large models have been exhaustively shown to perform better (Kaplan et al., 2020). But in this case, our model is more sample efficient and faster while using the same computational resources.\n\nI don't have access to a supercomputer-is this still useful for me? Though this work has focused on extremely large models, we also find that models with as few as two experts improves performance while easily fitting within memory constraints of commonly available GPUs or TPUs (details in Appendix D). We therefore believe our techniques are useful in small-scale settings.",

Our controlled experiments show for a fixed amount of computation and time, sparse models outperform dense models.\n\nI can't deploy a trillion parameter model-can we shrink these models?

Deterministically selecting the top expert always amounts to an exploitative strategy - we consider balancing exploration to seek better expert assignment.\n\nTo introduce exploration, we consider several approaches: 1) deterministic or argmax 2) sampling from the softmax distribution 3) input dropout on the incoming representation 4) multiplicative jitter noise on the incoming representation. The resulting impact on model quality is reported in Table 11. Throughout this work, we use input jitter to inject noise as we have found it to empirically perform the best.",

In Stage 2 we look at all tokens that have overflowed and route them to the expert with which has the second highest probability. Tokens can still be overflowed if their second highest expert has too many tokens, but this allows most of the tokens to be routed.
