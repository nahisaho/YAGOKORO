These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021). These efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance. However, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022) shows that, for a given compute budget, the best performances are not achieved by the largest models, but by smaller models trained on more data.\n\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoffmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best scale the dataset and model sizes for a particular training compute budget. However, this objective disregards the inference budget, which becomes critical when serving a language model at scale.",

First, we use an efficient implementation of the causal multi-head attention to reduce memory usage and runtime. This implementation, available in the xformers library, 2 is inspired by Rabe and Staats (2021) and uses the backward from Dao et al. (2022). This is achieved by not storing the attention weights and not computing the key/query scores that are masked due to the causal nature of the language modeling task.\n\nTo further improve training efficiency, we reduced the amount of activations that are recomputed during the backward pass with checkpointing. More precisely, we save the activations that are expensive to compute, such as the outputs of linear layers. This is achieved by manually implementing the backward function for the transformer layers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd.

(2021) and use the likelihood normalized by the number of characters in the completion, except for certain datasets (OpenBookQA, BoolQ), for which we follow Brown et al.

The model needs to generate a Python program that fits the description and satisfies the test cases. In Table 8, we compare the pass@1 scores of our models with existing language models that have not been finetuned on code, namely PaLM and LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022). PaLM and LLaMA were trained on datasets that contain a similar number of code tokens.\n\nAs show in Table 8, for a similar number of parameters, LLaMA outperforms other general models such as LaMDA and PaLM, which are not trained or finetuned specifically for code. LLaMA with 13B parameters and more outperforms LaMDA 137B on both HumanEval and MBPP. LLaMA 65B also outperforms PaLM 62B, even when it is trained longer.

We use the same method as Chen et al. (2021) to obtain unbiased estimates of the pass@k.\n\nIt is possible to improve the performance on code by finetuning on code-specific tokens. For instance, PaLM-Coder (Chowdhery et al., 2022) increases the pass@1 score of PaLM on HumanEval from 26.2% for PaLM to 36%. Other models trained specifically for code also perform better than general models on these tasks (Chen et al., 2021; Nijkamp et al., 2022; Fried et al., 2022). Finetuning on code tokens is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nTable 8: Model performance for code generation. We report the pass@ score on HumanEval and MBPP.

We evaluate our models in the 5-shot setting, using the examples provided by the benchmark, and report results in Table 9. On this benchmark, we observe that the LLaMA-65B is behind both Chinchilla70B and PaLM-540B by a few percent in average, and across most domains. A potential explanation is that we have used a limited amount of books and academic papers in our pre-training data, i.e., ArXiv, Gutenberg and Books3, that sums up to only 177GB, while these models were trained on up to 2TB of books. This large quantity of books used by Gopher, Chinchilla and PaLM may also explain why Gopher outperforms GPT-3 on this benchmark, while it is comparable on other benchmarks.",

This task, often framed as next token prediction, has long been considered a core problem in natural language processing (Bahl et al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990). Because Turing (1950) proposed to measure machine intelligence by using language through the 'imitation game', language modeling has been proposed as a benchmark to measure progress toward artificial intelligence (Mahoney, 1999).\n\nArchitecture. Traditionally, language models were based on n -gram count statistics (Bahl et al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques were proposed to improve the estimation of rare events (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995).

More recently, transformer networks, based on self-attention, have led to important improvements, especially for capturing long range dependencies (Vaswani et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019).\n\nScaling. There is a long history of scaling for language models, for both the model and dataset sizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the benefits of using language models trained on 2 trillion tokens, resulting in 300 billion n -grams, on the quality of machine translation.

Most notably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while being more than 10 × smaller, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. Unlike previous studies, we show that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance by training exclusively on publicly available data, without resorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that releasing these models to the research community will accelerate the development of large language models, and help efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and bias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al. (2022) that finetuning these models on instructions lead to promising results, and we plan to further investigate this in future work.",

For TriviaQA we evaluate on the dev set of the filtered set. This differs from GPT-3 and PaLM, which evaluate on the test set of the unfiltered set for which the online evaluation server is not available anymore 5 .\n\nWe generate answers using greedy decoding, and extract an answer from the generation by stopping at the first line break, final dot or comma. Generated answers are evaluated with the standard exact match metric: a generated answer is considered correct if it matches any answer of the list of answers after normalization. For this normalization step we lowercase generated answers and remove articles, punctuation and duplicate whitespaces. Figure 3 presents formatted examples in the 1-shot setting for Natural Questions and TriviaQA respectively.",

It seems to be the fastest growing sequence in mathematics.\n\nThe sequence was discovered by Leonardo of Pisa around 1200. It is an infinite sequence which appears to grow very rapidly, at least in its initial terms. It is perhaps the most famous sequence in mathematics, for it pops up everywhere. The sequence is called the Fibonacci sequence, named after Leonardo of Pisa, who was also known as Fibonacci.\n\nHe first investigated this sequence in his famous Liber abaci of 1202, when he studied the growth in the population of rabbits based on idealized assumptions.

LeCun's latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and rap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the field of deep learning, covering a range of topics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia.\n\nYann LeCun, the rap game's newest emcee.\n\nThe album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In fact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun's flow is surprisingly good, and he's not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album's production is solid, the sound is a little rough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a wordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let's take a closer look at some of the songs. Deep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for the future of AI.",

In this song, LeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the future of AI. LeCun's singing is at its best in this song.

I often wondered what it was like to be a grain of sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world. I longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\n\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried out to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terrified that I would soon be swallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore, along with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to find that this new shore was even more beautiful than my old one.",

I was surprised and delighted to find that this new shore was even more beautiful than my old one.\n\nI soon learned that this new shore was a very special place. It was a place where new life was constantly being created. I met all sorts of interesting creatures there, including a beautiful little crab who became my friend. We spent many happy hours together exploring our little world.\n\nOne day, my friend the crab told me that he had always wanted to see what lay beyond the boundaries of our world. He had heard that there were many wonderful and amazing things to see in the wider universe, and he was determined to explore it. I was sad to see him go, but I wished him well on his journey.\n\nTo my amazement, my little friend eventually returned, and he was not alone. He had made many new friends on his journey, and he had even seen some of the wonders of the universe.",

At least I'm honest about my ambitions.

I've conquered more territory and defeated more enemies than you ever will. And I did it all for Rome, not for myself.\n\nNapoleon: Oh, please. You only care about yourself. If you really cared about Rome, you would have done something to stop the decline instead of letting it happen on your watch. Julius Caesar: The decline of Rome is not my fault.
