    "abstract": "The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as \"What are the main themes in the dataset?\", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages: first, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.",

Given a sensemaking query and a text with an implicit and interconnected set of concepts, an LLM can generate a summary that answers the query. The challenge, however, arises when the volume of data requires a RAG approach, since vector RAG approaches are unable to support sensemaking over an entire corpus.\n\nIn this paper, we present GraphRAG - a graph-based RAG approach that enables sensemaking over the entirety of a large text corpus. GraphRAG first uses an LLM to construct a knowledge graph, where nodes correspond to key entities in the corpus and edges represent relationships between those entities. Next, it partitions the graph into a hierarchy of communities of closely related entities, before using an LLM to generate community-level summaries.",

To demonstrate this ability, we developed a novel application of the LLM-as-a-judge technique (Zheng et al., 2024) suitable for questions targeting broad issues and themes where there is no ground-truth answer. This approach first uses one LLM to generate a diverse set of global sensemaking questions based on corpus-specific use cases, before using a second LLM to judge the answers of two different RAG systems using predefined criteria (defined in Section 3.3). We use this approach to compare GraphRAG to vector RAG on two representative real-world text datasets. Results show GraphRAG strongly outperforms vector RAG when using GPT-4 as the LLM.",

The query and retrieved records populate a prompt template, which is then passed to the LLM (Ram et al., 2023). RAG is ideal when the total number of records in a data source is too large to include in a single prompt to the LLM, i.e. the amount of text in the data source exceeds the LLM's context window.\n\nIn canonical RAG approaches, the retrieval process returns a set number of records that are semantically similar to the query and the generated answer uses only the information in those retrieved records. A common approach to conventional RAG is to use text embeddings, retrieving records closest to the query in vector space where closeness corresponds to semantic similarity (Gao et al., 2023).",

GraphRAG contrasts with vector RAG in its ability to answer queries that require global sensemaking over the entire data corpus.\n\nGraphRAG builds upon prior work on advanced RAG strategies. GraphRAG leverages summaries over large sections of the data source as a form of 'self-memory' (described in Cheng et al. 2024), which are later used to answer queries as in Mao et al. 2020). These summaries are generated in parallel and iteratively aggregated into global summaries, similar to prior techniques (Feng et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023; Khattab et al., 2022; Shao et al., 2023; Su et al., 2020; Trivedi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024).",

Other techniques (Wang et al., 2023b) use the knowledge graph to enhance retrieval, where at query time an LLM-based agent dynamically traverses a graph with nodes representing document elements (e.g., passages, tables) and edges encoding lexical and semantical similarity or structural relationships. GraphRAG contrasts with these approaches by focusing on a previously unexplored quality of graphs in this context: their inherent modularity (Newman, 2006) and the ability to partition graphs into nested modular communities of closely related nodes (e.g., Louvain, Blondel et al. 2008; Leiden, Traag et al. 2019). Specifically, GraphRAG recursively creates increasingly global summaries by using the LLM to create summaries spanning this community hierarchy.",

In this work, we propose an approach for generating a set of questions for evaluating global sensemaking over the entirety of the corpus. Our approach is related to LLM methods that use a corpus to generate questions whose answers would be summaries of the corpus, such as in Xu and Lapata (2021). However, in order to produce a fair evaluation, our method avoids generating the questions directly from the corpus itself (as an alternative implementation, one can use a subset of the corpus held out from subsequent graph extraction and answer evaluation steps).",

These summaries are independently useful as a way to understand the global structure and semantics of the dataset, and may themselves be used to make sense of a corpus in the absence of a specific query. For example, a user may scan through community summaries at one level looking for general themes of interest, then read linked reports at a lower level that provide additional details for each subtopic. Here, however, we focus on their utility as part of a graph-based index used for answering global queries.\n\nGraphRAG generates community summaries by adding various element summaries (for nodes, edges, and related claims) to a community summary template.

Since each pairwise comparison in Experiment 1 was performed five times, while the claim-based metrics provided only one outcome per comparison, we aggregated the Experiment 1 results into a single label using majority voting. For example, if C0 won over SS in three out of five judgments for comprehensiveness on a given question, C0 was labeled the winner and SS the loser.

One possible solution is to define a tie based on a threshold (e.g., the absolute difference between the claim-based results for condition A and condition B must be less than or equal to x ). However, we observed that the results were sensitive to the choice of threshold. As a result, we focused on cases where the aggregated LLM label was not a tie, representing 33% and 39% of pairwise comparisons for comprehensiveness and diversity, respectively. In these cases, the aggregated LLM label matched the claim-based label in 78% of pairwise comparisons for comprehensiveness and 69-70% for diversity (across all distance thresholds), indicating moderately strong alignment.",

This includes RAG approaches that operate in a more local manner, via embedding-based matching of user queries and graph annotations. In particular, we see potential in hybrid RAG schemes that combine embeddingbased matching with just-in-time community report generation before employing our map-reduce summarization mechanisms. This 'roll-up' approach could also be extended across multiple levels of the community hierarchy, as well as implemented as a more exploratory 'drill down' mechanism that follows the information scent contained in higher-level community summaries.\n\nBroader impacts . As a mechanism for question answering over large document collections, there are risks to downstream sensemaking and decision-making tasks if the generated answers do not accurately represent the source data.",

Initial evaluations show substantial improvements over a vector RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of answers, as well as favorable comparisons to a global but graph-free approach using map-reduce source text summarization. For situations requiring many global queries over the same dataset, summaries of root-level communities in the entity-based graph index provide a data index that is both superior to vector RAG and achieves competitive performance to other global methods at a fraction of the token cost.",

Self-reflection is a prompt engineering technique where the LLM generates an answer, and is then prompted to evaluate its output for correctness, clarity, or completeness, then finally generate an improved response based on that evaluation (Huang et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2022). We leverage self-reflection in knowledge graph extraction, and explore ways how removing self-reflection affects performance and cost.\n\nUsing larger chunk size is less costly in terms of calls to the LLM.

However, the LLM tends to extract few entities from chunks of larger size. For example, in a sample dataset (HotPotQA, Yang et al., 2018), GPT-4 extracted almost twice as many entity references when the chunk size was 600 tokens than when it was 2400. To address this issue, we deploy a self-reflection prompt engineering approach. After entities are extracted from a chunk, we provide the extracted entities back to the LLM, prompting it to 'glean' any entities that it may have missed. This is a multi-stage process in which we first ask the LLM to assess whether all entities were extracted, using a logit bias of 100 to force a yes/no decision. If the LLM responds that entities were missed, then a continuation indicating that 'MANY entities were missed in the last extraction' encourages the LLM to detect these missing entities.",

Given the potential for information to be 'lost in the middle' of longer contexts (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023), we wanted to explore the effects of varying the context window size for our combinations of datasets, questions, and metrics. In particular, our goal was to determine the optimum context size for our baseline condition ( SS ) and then use this uniformly for all query-time LLM use. To that end, we tested four context window sizes: 8k, 16k, 32k and 64k. Surprisingly, the smallest context window size tested (8k) was universally better for all comparisons on comprehensiveness (average win rate of 58.1%), while performing comparably with larger context sizes on diversity (average win rate = 52.4%), and empowerment (average win rate = 51.3%).",

Answer 1 is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed list of public figures from a wider range of entertainment sectors, including film, television, music, sports, gaming, and digital media. It also includes examples of their contributions and the impact they have on their respective fields, as well as mentions of controversies and their implications. Answer 2, while detailed in its coverage of a few individuals, is limited to a smaller number of public figures and focuses primarily on their personal lives and relationships rather than a broad spectrum of their professional influence across the entertainment industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|              | Diversity: Winner=1 (Graph RAG) . Answer 1 is better because it provides a more varied and rich response by covering a wide range of public figures from different sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, television, music, sports, gaming, and digital media. It offers insights into the contributions and influence of these figures, as well as controversies and their impact on public discourse. The answer also cites specific data sources for each mentioned figure, indicating a diverse range of evidence to support the claims. In contrast, Answer 2 focuses on a smaller group of public figures, primarily from the music industry and sports, and relies heavily on a single source for data, which makes it less diverse in perspectives and insights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|              | Empowerment: Winner=1 (Graph RAG) . Answer 1 is better because it provides a comprehensive and structured overview of public figures across various sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, television, music, sports, and digital media. It lists multiple individuals, providing specific examples of their contributions and the context in which they are mentioned in entertainment articles, along with references to data reports for each claim. This approach helps the reader understand the breadth of the topic and make informed judgments without being misled. In contrast, Answer 2 focuses on a smaller group of public figures and primarily discusses their personal lives and relationships, which may not provide as broad an understanding of the topic. While Answer 2 also cites sources, it does not match the depth and variety of Answer 1.                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|              | Directness: Winner=2 (Na¨ ıve RAG) . Answer 2 is better because it directly lists specific public figures who are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles, such as Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake, and provides concise explanations for their frequent mentions. Answer 1, while comprehensive, includes a lot of detailed information about various figures in different sectors of entertainment, which, while informative, does not directly answer the question with the same level of conciseness and specificity as Answer 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |"
