The original WebText dataset was a web scrape of outbound links from Reddit through December 2017 which received at least 3 karma. In the second version, WebText2, we added outbound Reddit links from the period of January to October 2018, also with a minimum of 3 karma. The karma threshold served as a heuristic for whether people found the link interesting or useful. The text of the new links was extracted with the Newspaper3k python library. In total, the dataset consists of 20.3M documents containing 96 GB of text and 1 . 62 × 10 10 words (as defined by wc ). We then apply the reversible tokenizer described in [RWC + 19], which yields 2 . 29 × 10 10 tokens. We reserve 6 . 6 × 10 8 of these tokens for use as a test set, and we also test on similarlyprepared samples of Books Corpus [ZKZ + 15], Common Crawl [Fou], English Wikipedia, and a collection of publicly-available Internet Books.",

But with fixed finite D , we also do not expect any model to be capable of approaching the best possible loss (ie the entropy of text). Similarly, a model with fixed size will be capacity-limited. These considerations motivate our second principle. Note that knowledge of L ( N ) at infinite D and L ( D ) at infinite N fully determines all the parameters in L ( N,D ) .\n\nThe third principle is more speculative. There is a simple and general reason one might expect overfitting to scale ∝ 1 /D at very large D . Overfitting should be related to the variance or the signal-to-noise ratio of the dataset [AS17], and this scales as 1 /D . This expectation should hold for any smooth loss function, since we expect to be able to expand the loss about the D →∞ limit.",

Sample efficiency (show here for training far below the critical batch size) improves greatly as well, improving by a factor of almost 100 when comparing the smallest possible model to a very large one.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 20 This figure provides information about the performance per token as a function of model size and training time.

We see that models trained on n ctx = 1024 show steady improvement with model size on all but the first token.\n\nFixing model size, it appears that the loss scales as a power-law as a function of position T in the context, see Figure 20. This may be a consequence of underlying power-law correlations in language [EP94, ACDE12, LT16], or a more general feature of the model architecture and optimization. It provides some suggestion for the potential benefits (or lack thereof) from training on larger contexts. Not only do larger models converge to better performance at T = 1024 , but they also improve more quickly at early tokens, suggesting that larger models are more efficient at detecting patterns with less contextual information. In the right-hand plot we show how per-token performance varies for a fixed model as a function of the training step.",
