Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model. Imagen achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the COCO dataset, without ever training on COCO, and human raters find Imagen samples to be on par with the COCO data itself in image-text alignment. To assess text-to-image models in greater depth, we introduce DrawBench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for text-to-image models.

These models have transformed the research community and captured widespread public attention with creative image generation [22, 54] and editing applications [21, 41, 34]. To pursue this research direction further, we introduce Imagen, a text-to-image diffusion model that combines the power of transformer language models (LMs) [15, 52] with high-fidelity diffusion models [28, 29, 16, 41] to deliver an unprecedented degree of photorealism and a deep level of language understanding in text-to-image synthesis. In contrast to prior work that uses only image-text data for model training [e.g., 53, 41], the key finding behind Imagen is that text embeddings from large LMs [52, 15], pretrained on text-only corpora, are remarkably effective for text-to-image synthesis.

Text encoders trained on paired image-text data are standard in current text-to-image models; they can be trained from scratch [41, 53] or pretrained on image-text data [54] (e.g., CLIP [49]). The image-text training objectives suggest that these text encoders may encode visually semantic and meaningful representations especially relevant for the text-to-image generation task. Large language models can be another models of choice to encode text for text-to-image generation. Recent progress in large language models (e.g., BERT [15], GPT [47, 48, 7], T5 [52]) have led to leaps in textual understanding and generative capabilities. Language models are trained on text only corpus significantly larger than paired image-text data, thus being exposed to a very rich and wide distribution of text.",

Diffusion models [63, 28, 65] are a class of generative models that convert Gaussian noise into samples from a learned data distribution via an iterative denoising process.

We find that this is due to a train-test mismatch arising from high guidance weights. At each sampling step t , the x -prediction ˆ x t 0 must be within the same bounds as training data x , i.e. within [ -1 , 1] , but we find empirically that high guidance weights cause x -predictions to exceed these bounds. This is a train-test mismatch, and since the diffusion model is iteratively applied on its own output throughout sampling, the sampling process produces unnatural images and sometimes even diverges.

During inference, the model receives the full 256 × 256 low-resolution images as inputs, and returns upsampled 1024 × 1024 images as outputs. Note that we use text cross attention for both our super-resolution models.",

The key automated performance metrics used are FID [26] to measure image fidelity, and CLIP score [25, 49] to measure image-text alignment. Consistent with previous works, we report zero-shot FID-30K, for which 30K prompts are drawn randomly from the validation set, and the model samples generated on these prompts are compared with reference images from the full validation set. Since guidance weight is an important ingredient to control image quality and text alignment, we report most of our ablation results using trade-off (or pareto ) curves between CLIP and FID scores across a range of guidance weights.\n\nBoth FID and CLIP scores have limitations, for example FID is not fully aligned with perceptual quality [42], and CLIP is ineffective at counting [49].",

We use two experimental paradigms:\n\n1. To probe image quality, the rater is asked to select between the model generation and reference image using the question: 'Which image is more photorealistic (looks more real)?'. We report the percentage of times raters choose model generations over reference images (the preference rate ).\n2. To probe alignment, human raters are shown an image and a prompt and asked 'Does the caption accurately describe the above image?'. They must respond with 'yes', 'somewhat', or 'no'.

Recent work by [10] proposed a new evaluation set called PaintSkills to systematically evaluate visual reasoning skills and social biases beyond COCO. With similar motivation, we introduce DrawBench , a comprehensive and challenging set of prompts that support the evaluation and comparison of text-to-image models. DrawBench contains 11 categories of prompts, testing different capabilities of models such as the ability to faithfully render different colors, numbers of objects, spatial relations, text in the scene, and unusual interactions between objects.",

Table 2 reports the human evaluation to test image quality and alignment on the COCO validation set. We report results on the original COCO validation set, as well as a filtered version in which all reference data with people have been removed. For photorealism, Imagen achieves 39.2% preference rate indicating high image quality generation. On the set with no people, there is a boost in preference rate of Imagen to 43.6%, indicating Imagen's limited ability to generate photorealistic people. On caption similarity, Imagen's score is on-par with the original reference images, suggesting Imagen's ability to generate images that align well with COCO captions.",

However, a recent audit of one of our data sources, LAION-400M [61], uncovered a wide range of inappropriate content including pornographic imagery, racist slurs, and harmful social stereotypes [4]. This finding informs our assessment that Imagen is not suitable for public use at this time and also demonstrates the value of rigorous dataset audits and comprehensive dataset documentation (e.g. [23, 45]) in informing consequent decisions about the model's appropriate and safe use. Imagen also relies on text encoders trained on uncurated web-scale data, and thus inherits the social biases and limitations of large language models [5, 3, 50].\n\nWhile we leave an in-depth empirical analysis of social and cultural biases encoded by Imagen to future work, our small scale internal assessments reveal several limitations that guide our decision not to release Imagen at this time.",

First, all generative models, including Imagen, Imagen, may run into danger of dropping modes of the data distribution, which may further compound the social\n\nconsequence of dataset bias. Second, Imagen exhibits serious limitations when generating images depicting people. Our human evaluations found Imagen obtains significantly higher preference rates when evaluated on images that do not portray people, indicating a degradation in image fidelity. Finally, our preliminary assessment also suggests Imagen encodes several social biases and stereotypes, including an overall bias towards generating images of people with lighter skin tones and a tendency for images portraying different professions to align with Western gender stereotypes.",

Even when we focus generations away from people, our preliminary analysis indicates Imagen encodes a range of social and cultural biases when generating images of activities, events, and objects.\n\nWhile there has been extensive work auditing image-to-text and image labeling models for forms of social bias (e.g. [8, 9, 68]), there has been comparatively less work on social bias evaluation methods for text-to-image models, with the recent exception of [10]. We believe this is a critical avenue for future research and we intend to explore benchmark evaluations for social and cultural bias in future work-for example, exploring whether it is possible to generalize the normalized pointwise mutual information metric [1] to the measurement of biases in image generation models.",

This reduction of generation to denoising is justified as optimizing a weighted variational lower bound on the data log likelihood under the diffusion model, or as a form of denoising score matching [72, 65, 28, 35]. We use the glyph[epsilon1] -prediction parameterization, defined as ˆ x θ ( z t , λ t , c ) = ( z t -σ t glyph[epsilon1] θ ( z t , λ t , c )) /α t , and we impose a squared error loss on glyph[epsilon1] θ in glyph[epsilon1] space with t sampled according to a cosine schedule [40]. This corresponds to a particular weighting w ( λ t ) and leads to a scaled score estimate glyph[epsilon1] θ ( z t , λ t , c ) ≈ -σ t ∇ z t log p ( z t | c ) , where p ( z t | c ) is the true density of z",

While generation using larger values of aug \\_ level gives slightly worse FID, it allows more varied range of CLIP scores, suggesting more diverse generations by the superresolution model. In practice, for our best samples, we generally use aug \\_ level in [0 . 1 , 0 . 3] . Using large values of aug \\_ level and high guidance weights for the super-resolution models, Imagen can create different variations of a given 64 × 64 image by altering the prompts to the super-resolution models (See Fig. A.12 for examples).",
